  "text": "A universal model for languages and cities, and their lifetimes \nÇağlar Tuncay \nDepartment of Physics, Middle East Technical University \n06531 Ankara, Turkey \ncaglart@metu.edu.tr\n \n   Abstract: Present human languages display slightly asymmetric log-normal (Gauss) \ndistribution for size [1-3], whereas present cities follow power law (Pareto-Zipf law)[4]. Our \nmodel considers the competition between languages and that between cities in terms of \ngrowing (multiplicative noise process)[5] and fragmentation [6]; where, relevant parameters \nare (naturally) different for languages and cities. We consider lifetime distribution for old and \nliving languages and that for old and living cities. We study also the effect of random \nelimination (punctuation) within time evolution of languages and cities. Finally, we assume \ndecreasing exponential distribution for cities over size with independent random amplitude \nand random (negative) exponent; and show that, this gives the Pareto-Zipf law. \n \n1   Introduction: Our essential aim is to show that similar processes may be governing time \nevolution of competition between languages or cities, yet with different parameters, where the \nmost crucial ones are two: Rate for the growth within a multiplicative noise process [5] and a \nfactor for fragmentation [6]. It is similar to real life; origination (birth), spread and extinction \ntakes place in terms of fragmentation and growth is due to multiplicative noise process. \n   Empirical criteria for our results are: i) Number of living languages and that of living cities \n(towns, villages, etc.) may be different; but, total size for the present time must be the same \nfor both cases, where the mentioned size is world population. ii) World population increases \nexponentially (super exponentially, for recent times) with time.[3, 7] iii) At present, the \nbiggest language (Mandarin Chinese) is spoken by about 1.025 billion people and world \npopulation (as, the prediction made by United Nations) is 6.5 billion in 2005, (and to be about \n10 billion in 2050) [7]; so the ratio of the size for the biggest language to (the total size, i.e.,) \nworld population must be (about) 1:6.5. iv) Size distribution for the present time must be \nslightly asymmetric log-normal for languages [1], and this must be power law -1 for the \npresent cities (Pareto-Zipf law)[4]. It is known that, many (old) languages and (old) cities are \nnot living at present. So, we consider random elimination in both cases (punctuation); which \nmight have occurred due to some historical reasons, such as mass immigration, being \ncolonized, lose of war, and wide spread illness, etc. Secondly, we aim at showing that Pareto-\nZipf law may be emerging from decreasing exponential distribution of number of cities over \nsize, where independent random numbers are used; one for amplitude and one for (negative) \nexponent. Following section is the model, and next one is applications and results. Last \nsection is devoted for discussion and conclusion. We will display some more properties of the \nmentioned exponential functions within Appendix. \n \n2   Model: For languages or cities (i), we have various number of ancestors (M(0)), all of \nwhich have random initial size Pi(0). They grow in time (t), with a random rate (Ri≤R, where \nR is universal) within a random multiplicative noise process, \n \nPi(t) = (1 + Ri)Pi(t − 1)  ,  \n \n \n(1) \n \nand if a random number is smaller than the splitting probability H, then the language or city \n(i) splits, with the splitting ratio (fragmentation, mutation factor) S, which has the following \nmeaning: If the current number of speakers of a language or population of a city (i) is Pi(t), \nSPi(t) many members form another population and (1−S)Pi(t) many survive during the \n \n- 1 -\nfragmentation at t. Number of languages or cities (M(t)) increases by one if one language or \ncity (i) splits; if any two of them split at t, then M(t) increases by two, etc. Furthermore, we \nassume that, if for H<<1 this random number is larger than some G near 1, the language or the \ncity becomes extinct. It is obvious that, results do not change if 1 − S is substituted for S, i.e., \nif the mutated and surviving members are interchanged. So, the greatest value for S is 0.5, \neffectively. Please note that, fragmentation causes new agents to emerge (birth), and at the \nsame time it drives them to extinction in terms of splitting, and any language or city with a \nmember less than unity is considered as extinct. \n   Time evolution of (total number of human speaking all of the current languages or living in \nall of the current cities, i.e.,) world population is \n \nW(t) = ∑ M(t)\ni=1Pi(t)  ,   \n \n \n(2) \nwhere a city may actually also be a village of single house, except if we demand a minimum \npopulation. \n   It is obvious that, if one changes M(0) to M'(0) without changing origin and unit for time \nscale, then M(t) must be changed to M'(t), where M'(t)= M(t)(M'(0)/M(0)). Secondly, if time \nsteps of the evolution are long enough (and the total number of time steps is small), we may \nhave more fragmentation per unit time. If on the other hand, time steps are considerably short \n(for big number of total time steps), intermittency may become crucial. Moreover, there may \nbe various other reasons for waiting periods of time in fragmentation, as well as in population \ngrowth. We assumed an intermittency factor (H) for splitting, which is taken same for all of \nlanguages or of cities. Please note that, H =1=G gives gradual evolution, where we have a \nregular fragmentation with H (and, with some S) at each time step t. This case is kept out of \nthe present scope, because we consider it as (historically) unrealistic. Thirdly, we know that \nnot all of the ancestor and old languages or cities survive, and we have many ancient (and \nolder) languages which are not spoken any more and many of the old cities are archeological \nsites now. The relevant number of people might have immigrated and changed the language \nand city, they might have changed their language after being colonized within the same cities \nand they might have became totally extinct after a lost war, or after a wide spread and severe \nillness, etc. We count such cases as random eliminations by the rate G, at each t. We keep the \n(historical) reasons out of the present scope, and consider only the results; and once the \nreasons are kept away, the results of them may naturally be taken as random. In summary; if a \nrandom number (which is defined for each t) is smaller than H, for H<1, then the language or \ncity splits (by S); and, if the random number is larger than some G near 1, then the language \nor city becomes extinct; and, in between it grows (for each time step by R, at most). Number \nof languages or cities increases, decreases, or fluctuates about M(0) for (relatively) big \nnumbers for H (high fragmentation) and G (low elimination), for small numbers for H (low \nfragmentation) and G (high elimination), and for H+G=1 (equal fragmentation and \nelimination), respectively; out of which we regard only the first case, where we have (for \n1<H+G) increase in the number of agents and we disregard the others. Because, it is known \n(guessed) that the number of cities (languages) did not decrease ever in past. We try several \nnumber of ancestors M(0), with sizes Pi(0), for the selected case, where we assign new \nrandom growth rates for new languages or cities, which are not changed later, as well as the \ngrowth rates for ancestors are kept as same through the time evolution. \n   For lifetime, we simply subtract the number of time step at which a language or city is \ngenerated, from that one at which the given agent became extinct, where the agent may \nbecome extinct since its size becomes less then unity in terms of fragmentation or since it is \nrandomly eliminated. In any case, we have two different definitions for lifetime; one is for the \nextinct agents and the other is for living agents (age). We may define μ(τ,t) as the probability \n(density) function, where t stands for the number of time steps, and τ stands for ages, and μ \n \n- 2 -\ncounts the languages or cities with age τ at t (with 0<τ ≤t). It is obvious that, the integral of μ \noverτ (with 0<τ ≤t) gives the number of living (not all, but) generated languages or cities at t, \nwhich is equal to the number of total living agents (M(t)) minus the number of living \nancestors, which goes zero with tÆ∞. \n   Please note that, the introduced parameters have units involving time, and our time unit is \narbitrary. After some period of evolution in time we (reaching the present) stop the simulation \nand calculate probability distribution function (PDF) for size, and for some other functions \nsuch as extinction frequency, lifetime, etc., (for languages or cities).  Number of interaction \ntours may be chosen as arbitrary (without following historical time, since we do not have \nhistorical data), with different time units; and, the parameters (with units) may be refined \naccordingly. Yet, in most cases relative values (with respect to other cases; population growth \nrate in different runs, for example) and ratios of the parameters (the ratio of S to H, for \nexample) are important. \n \n3   Applications and results: Languages and cities are man made systems; and, language is \nnot a physical quantity, whereas city is a physical quantity. Yet, we find many similarities \nbetween them. We first consider languages (sect. 3.1), later we study cities (sect. 3.2), in \nsection 3.3 we compare the results for languages and cities; and finally, in section 3.4, we \nutilize exponential (decreasing) functions with two independent random numbers; one for the \namplitude and one for the (negative) exponent, where our essential aim is to show that the \nmentioned sum gives Pareto-Zipf power law for size distribution. \n3.1   Languages: In our initial world (at our t=0) we have M(0) (=100) many languages, each \nof which is spoken by randomly chosen Pi(0) (≤10,000) people; thus, the initial world \npopulation (W(0)) is about 500,000, since average of the (homogeneous) random numbers \nbetween zero and unity is 0.5. Thus we assume power law zero for the initial distribution of \nlanguages over size, i.e., M(P) ∝ PP0, for initial parameters M(0) and P (0). \ni\n   It is obvious that, we may not set our time origin correctly, because not a real data for the \ninitial time is available to match with. Yet, we may assume a homogeneous distribution of \nsize over initial languages. In fact, we tried many smooth (Gauss, exponential, etc.) initial \ndistributions (not shown); and, all of them undergone similar time evolutions within about \n3000 time steps, under the present process of random multiplication for growth, and (random) \nfragmentation for spread and origination and extinction, where we utilized various \ncombinations of the relevant parameters, including H and G. We tried also delta distribution, \nwhich is equivalent to assuming single ancestor, for the initial case; it also evolved into a \nslightly asymmetric log-normal one (with different set of parameters, certainly; not shown) in \ntime. In all of them, we observe that, the language distribution at present is independent of \ninitial distributions, disregarding some extra ordinary ones. \n      Evolution without elimination (G=1): Number of languages (M(t)) and population of \nworld (W(t)) increases exponentially in time, as shown in Figure 1, where the arrow for \nlanguages (dashed line) has the slope 0.000095, and that for world population (solid line) has \nslope 0.002530, where the parameters are: R=0.00752 and H=0.0022, with S=0.49999 (others \nare same as before). \n   Within the present section we utilize 3000 time steps, as shown in Fig.1, where we consider \nthe present time (the year 2000) as t=1920, which is indicated by a two sided arrow in Fig.1. \nWe show the portion for 1920 <t<3000, because we will make some comments (predictions) \nfor languages about future (and also for cities; since there are close relations between them). \nPlease note that, at t=1920 (present time, the year 2000) we have 7,168 languages and the \nworld population is about 10 billion (Fig. 1). \n   Figure 2 is the time evolution of size distribution of languages (PDF), all of which split and \ngrow by the same parameters, i.e., S, R, H (all same as declared in the third paragraph of this \n \n- 3 -\nsection), and G=1 (thus, we do not have abrupt (punctuated) elimination of languages here). \nLower plot is historical (t=270, open circles) and upper one (squares) is for the present time \n(t=1920).  In Fig. 2 we observe that; initial languages spread in number by fragmentation, \nthen we have new languages, which split from the previous bigger ones (right). New \nlanguages emerge also from the small ones (left). And all of them grow in size in terms of a \nrandom multiplicative noise process. Growing rates are similar; yet, bigger ones grow (if they \ndo) in bigger amounts at each time step. We observe that, small languages grew from few \ndecades to more (yet few) decades (with a time period of 1650 (=1920-270) time steps); \nwhereas, the biggest language grew (within the same time period) from few tens of thousands \nto a billion as we observe at right end of Fig. 2 (Chinese, in reality). In the meantime world \npopulation grew (exponentially) from (about) half million to about 10 billion; and number of \nlanguages increased (exponentially) from (about) 197 to (about) 7,168. We have parabolic fit \n(dashed line) in Fig. 2, which indicates that the present distribution is slightly asymmetric log-\nnormal. (For the empirical distribution of the present languages; see, [1, and 2-3].) \n   We may summary our results, in some of which we utilized several other combinations of \nthe declared parameters (not shown) as: 1- For many combinations of parameters, we get \nasymmetric log-normal distributions (for example, for H=0.003 (with R=0.00752, and S=0.1) \nabout 70,000 languages (not 7,000) may outcome; not shown), where asymmetry may be \nslight or more depending upon the parameters. On the other hand, as M(0) increases without \nchanging other parameters, top of the plot for M(P) rises up; and as Pi(0) increases, width and \nthe area (i.e., world population W(t)) under the plot increases, all for a given number of time \nsteps. Please note that, M(0) and W(0) (i.e., sum of Pi(0) over i for 1≤i≤M(0)) is the amplitude \nof the (asymptotically) exponential function M(t) and W(t), respectively (not shown). 2- \nIncrease in H, lifts the left end and top of the plot for M(P) and widens it for a given W(t), \nsince we have more generated agents (due to high fragmentation) per time step. 3- Increase in \nR, extends the plot for M(P) along two directions; i.e., it widens the plot at left (small \nlanguages) and at right (big languages) end, since we have more rapid growth in every \nlanguage, where mutated (split) abundance also increases. In short; we obtain various plots, \nwhich are more or less (or almost) same as the empirical data for the present languages, with \ndifferent parameters. Our relevant comment is that, language distribution at present time may \nnot be unique and similar ones may be obtained with various combinations of parameters for \ninitial conditions and these for evolution, where range of each parameter used is considerably \nwide. We will revisit this issue in section 3.3. 4- One important observation that we make \nwithin our results is for 1920<t, i.e. for future: For a given asymmetric log-normal size \ndistribution of languages for the present time; as t increases, asymmetry increases (where we \nkeep all of the given the parameters as same, and increase t). Small languages end rises up \nwith decrease in local slope with time; in the meantime local slope for big languages end \nbecomes more and more steep. In short, small languages end becomes the top of the plot for \nM(P), and big languages end turns to be power law with exponent about negative unity (see, \nFigure 2, the plot in open squares, where the slope for plot in solid squares (at tail) is –0.7). \nThus, we have power law with exponent zero at the beginning, we have power law with \nexponent (about) negative unity for future, and intermediately i.e., at the present time we have \nlog-normal for size distribution. We will revisit the current issue in further paragraphs of this \nsection and in sections 3.2-3.4, and 4. \n   Time distribution of languages, is another important issue, besides the size distribution. We \nconsider here lifetime for the extinct languages and ages of the present ones. Figure 3 is the \nlifetimes of languages at present (t=1920, thick solid), past (t<1920, thin solid) and in future \n(1920<t, dashed). (Parameters are same as before.) Here, we observe that, many ancestors \nsurvive in all t; only two ancestor languages are found as mutated or having become extinct \nbefore t=1920. Secondly, generated languages are distributed exponentially (decreasing) with \n \n- 4 -\nage, in both cases. Inset is the number of speakers for each of the living language at present \ntime (which evolved out of the initial ones with random size.). The biggest present language \n(Chinese) is spoken by little more than one billion (1G, in the inset) human. \n   We obtained many similar results for the same parameters; yet, for different number of time \nsteps; where, we observed that, the (negative) exponent remained same in results. Secondly, \nwe tried the same number of time steps (as the one utilized within the previous case) and, we \nchange other parameters. Considering these (new) parameters, which give similar PDF for the \npresent empirical distribution of languages over size; we observed similar exponential \nbehavior for distribution of emerged languages over age, where the (negative) exponents \ndepend on the parameters. Consecutively, we may state that, generated languages are \ndistributed (decreasing) exponentially (independent of the parameters used) with age, and \n(negative) exponents depend on the parameters. It is obvious that, increasing H (directly, and \nincreasing R indirectly; since, any size hardly becomes less than unity for big R) promotes \nmany new languages to emerge. As a result, linear portions of the plots (left end in Fig. 4 \nwhich has logarithmic vertical axis for the number) becomes steeper; which means that, the \nexponents increase in absolute value. There, we may consider the situation as scaling the \n(horizontal) time axis; where, increasing H and R, amounts to increasing the unit for a time \nstep, and decreasing the number of time steps from the initial time (t=0) up to the present, and \nvice versa. \n   Elimination (G<1) plays a role, which is opposite to that of fragmentation (H) and growth \n(R) in evolution; where, H and R develop the evolution forward, and G recedes. So the present \ncompetition turns out to be one between H and R, and G. Number of languages are essentially \ndetermined by H and G, where two criteria are crucial: For a given number of time steps, R, \nand M(0), etc., there is a critical value for G; where, for Gcritical<G ≅1 languages survive, and \nfor smaller values of G (i.e., if G≅Gcritical) languages may become extinct totally. Secondly, \nsum of H and G is a decisive parameter for the evolution: If for a given G (with Gcritical<G), \nH+G=1, then the number of languages does not increase and does not decrease, but oscillates \nabout M(0), since (almost) same amount of languages emerges (by H) and becomes extinct \n(by G) at each time step, and we have intermediate elimination. On the other hand, if H+G<1, \nthen languages decrease in number with time and we have high (strong, heavy) elimination. \nOnly for 1<H+G, (with G≠1) we have low (weak, light) elimination of languages, where the \nnumber increases (yet, slowly with respect to the case for G=1). It is obvious that, elimination \nslows down the evolution. It amounts to decreasing the unit for a time step, and increasing the \nnumber of time steps from the initial time (t=0) up to the present, and vice versa. So we need \nmore time to arrive at a given configuration of languages; i.e., total number, size, total size \nPDF, etc. \n   Now we introduce G=0.9996, with H=0.0022 (as before), where 1<H+G, and we have light \nelimination. We have the parameters (same, as before) for M(0) (=100, number of ancestors) \nand Pi(0) (≤10,000, number of initial speakers) which grows with the rate R=0.00752 (as \nbefore, Eq. (1)). At the end of 1920 time steps we have W about 13 billion and M about 3030 \n(Eq. (2)), where it may be observed that light elimination is effective on the number of \nlanguages rather than on world population. World population (W(t)) and number of languages \n(M(t)) increases exponentially (disregarding the abrupt and temporary recessions, not shown), \nwith exponents 0.00235, and 7.8x10-4, respectively. Figure 4 is the resulting size and the inset \nis time distribution of languages at t=1920 (solid squares, for size); where PDF is smaller in \nheight with respect to the one (solid squares) in Fig. 2. If we increase H to 0.0028 (keeping \nother parameters same as before) we observe a different picture (not shown); where, small \nsize end of the PDF plot is higher, since fragmentation is higher; yet, we do not have (small) \nlanguages spoken by few people. Many small languages are now spoken by some hundred or \nthousand human, at minimum. Languages move towards right on the plot (PDF) for size as \n \n- 5 -\ntheir speakers increase in number; and they move towards left as they fragment, and become \nextinct at the left end when they are spoken by no human. \n   Log-normal plot in open squares for t=3000 (future) in Fig. 4 is clearly asymmetric. It \ninvolves a long tail for big sizes, and a short arm for small sizes, top of the plot is for about \n100,000 speakers, etc. Please note that, the plot with open squares in Fig. 2 is for G=1, and for \nt=3000 (for future), and the only different parameter here, with respect to the corresponding \nplot in Fig. 2 is G. Initial conditions are similar (not same, because we have random Pi(0)) in \nboth cases, but evolution parameters are different; yet, the plots are similar in many aspects. \nFirst of all, in both cases we have higher left arm (for small languages) with respect to the \nplots for the present time; which implies that, present small languages will decay in time, \nwhere punctuation increases the rate for decay. Secondly, we have (decreasing) exponential \ntime distribution in both cases, and punctuation (G≠1) decreases the exponent in absolute \nvalue. As a result of punctuation, we may expect more people speaking a given language in \nfuture (due to some mechanism(s) else than fragmentation; for example, change of languages \nin terms of physical or cultural colonization, etc.), since top of the plot for future in Fig. 4 is \nlower than top of the corresponding plot in Fig. 2. On the other hand, as we mentioned \npreviously (two paragraphs before) that, presence of G<1 amounts to increasing the unit for \ntime steps. So, the plot in solid squares in Fig. 4 may be viewed as one for future with smaller \nparameters for H, and R. More clearly; if one utilizes bigger parameters for H, R, he may \nobtain the target configuration for languages for smaller t, if, G=1.  And, since G<1 eliminates \nM(t) (randomly) we need bigger parameters for H and R, to mimic the size distribution, world \npopulation, size of the biggest language, and other empirical data. As a result, size distribution \ncomes out with long tail for big size, and with short arm for small size. Moreover, sizes for \nsmall languages increase; i.e., we do not have languages spoken by few human, any more. \n   As time evolves, top of the PDF for size moves towards left, due to fragmentation (H), and \ntail becomes more and more crowded due to increase in population (R). As a result, we have \ntwo configurations: For some H (and R), we have (local) horizontal behavior for small size \n(saturation) and we have a decline for big size, which becomes roughly straight (in many of \nour runs, not shown). Secondly, for bigger H (without changing R), top of the plot rises at \nsmall language end, and we have (roughly) straight distribution for many big languages in \nlog-log axes, which means that we have power law (see, paragraph 6 of sect. 3.1). \n   We had already considered age distribution of the generated languages as (decreasing) \nexponentials in time for G=1, where age distribution for ancestor languages is delta function, \ni.e., same (=1920) for all of the ancestors. And now, we have similar exponential time \ndistribution for G<1, yet with smaller exponent in absolute value (not shown). Secondly, for \nG<1 number of living ancestors decreases in time with high fragmentation (not shown) and \nwith the same H for fragmentation as before (not shown), where we have only 32 ancestor \nlanguages present at t=1920, for G<1, with H=0.0022. \n   Please note that, ancestor languages may fragment at any time, t<1920; and they may give \nbirth to new languages, where size may vary in time for ancestor and generated languages. \nWe count these languages as ancestor, if their lifetime is 1920 (for 1920 time steps). Figure 5 \nis the (time) distribution for lifetime of the languages, which became extinct; and, the inset is \nthe relative frequency of events for extinction, all with G<1, where other parameters are same \nas before. \n   We observe that the distribution for lifetime for extinct languages are also (decreasing) \nexponential, with exponent 0.001 (as given by an exponential fit, not shown). As a result, \nmore languages become extinct in their youth and less ones become extinct as they become \nold. In other words, languages become extinct either with short lifetime (soon after their \ngeneration), or they hardly become extinct later and live long (which may be considered as a \n \n- 6 -\nkind of natural selection). It may be noted that, long living languages have many speakers, \nand they hardly become extinct in terms of splitting. \n   Certainly, we do not have any empirical record for time distribution of languages to \ncompare our results. Yet, the number of time steps we utilized (=1920) may correspond to \n(roughly) last 20,000 years of history; with the initial conditions M(0) (=100) and W(0) \n(=500,000). So, our time unit may correspond to about a decade in year; and, 10 to 100 time \nsteps (i.e., century to millennium) for a given (ancient) language to become extinct may be \nconsidered as reasonable. We count the number of extinct languages in Fig. 5 as 618 (about \n10% of the living ones), which may also be considered as reasonable. \n   Inset in Fig. 5 shows the ratio of languages which became extinct to the ones living at any t \n(0<t≤1920), where we observe cascades within extinctions, which decay in time. And, as time \nevolves, cascades disappear and we have a constant noise, for which we have the present \n(slightly asymmetric) log-normal size distribution (M(P)). \n   As the final remark of this section we note that, the number of time steps which we used \nwithin the runs are 3000, 2430, 1920, and 270; and, they go in squares; i.e. with 30m2, where \nm=10, 9, 8 and 3, respectively. It is because, we observed that size distribution develops in \n(roughly) equal amounts in log-log plot; if, we increase our maximum number of time steps in \nsquares. For example, consider Fig. 3; when we plot PDF for t=480 (m=4), 750 (m=5), 1080 \n(m=6), and 1470 (m=7) they fill in space between the plot for t=270 and t=1920 almost \nuniformly. And, if we continue for m=9, and 10, the mentioned uniformity survives. We think \nthat, evolution of language distribution for size may be running in steps, which are \nproportional to square of time periods. (Also; see, Figure 7, where number of ancestors \ndecreases (roughly) uniformly with square of time.) \n3.2   Cities: We claim that, initial world is not (much) relevant for the present size \nconfiguration of cities. Moreover, we may obtain similar configurations for various evolution \nparameters. In Figure 6, we display three PDF for size distributions, with different initial and \nevolution parameters, where the maximum population for ancestors (P=10,000), and splitting \nfactor (S=0.1), is same (with, G=1) for all. Please note that, S is not the maximum value \n(which is 0.5, effectively), since we think that any number of human may change their \nlanguage, yet a city may split only in small portions. On the other hand, it is known that, \nminimum size for a language is unity but it is not defined for a city. A city may actually also \nbe a village of single house, except if we demand a minimum population. For that reason we \nconsidered several minimum populations for a city. In Figure 6, slopes for linear fits (dashed \nlines) are about: 1) -1 (squares) 2) -1 (circles) and 3) -0.85 (stars). And,  utilized parameters \nare: 1) (squares) M(0)=100, R=0.005, H =0.01, number of time steps=2430, and minimum \npopulation for a city =626); 2) (circles), M(0)=100, R=0.0062, H =0.02, number of time \nsteps=3000, and minimum population for a city=740; and, 3) (stars) M(0)=10, R=0.005, H \n=0.015, number of time steps=1470, and minimum population for a city =1. We observed \nmany (other) power laws about minus unity for several (other) combinations of parameters \n(not shown), where we observe also that; a very wide range of parameters give the same \nPareto-Zipf law. And we obtain (decreasing) exponential time distributions for lifetime of \nextinct cities and ages of the livings ones for big M(0); and for M(0) less than or equal to \n(about) 10, the mentioned (decreasing) exponential distributions for lifetime changes in form. \nPlease see Figs. 3 and 4 for similar distributions for languages, and note that exponents are \nsame for different t, which may be utilized to predict the terminal number for cities, and that \nfor languages under some assumptions, as we will mention in section 3.3. \n   At present it is obvious that W(t) and M(t) increases exponentially, due to R and H, \nrespectively, since G=1. For Gcritical<G<1, increase in M(t) lessens, and for Gcritical<G, and \nG+H=1 we have oscillations in M(t) about M(0), which is not a realistic case, as the one for \nGcritical≅G<1, where we have few cities at the end, and we do not consider them here. \n \n- 7 -\n3.3   Languages and cities: It is worth to emphasize that, languages and cities are no longer \nthe same and that for some intermediate times the cities obey the 1/size law, while the \nlanguages obey the log-normal distribution, for the same (or better, similar) set of parameters. \n   As we mentioned in the previous section, time distribution of cities (lifetime for extinct \ncities and ages of the livings ones) are decreasing exponentials (disregarding the cases for \nsmall number of ancestors) as shown in Figure 7. Simple probability (density) functions are \nalso exponential (not shown), which means that cities occupy time distribution plots (Figs. 3, \n4, and 7) in exponential order; more cities for small t, and less cities for big t, for a given \nnumber of time steps in all. Inset of Fig. 7 is simple probability (density) function of living \ncities at t=1920, which is decreasing exponential with the rate (exponent) of 0.00185 per time \nstep, where the number of living ancestor cities is 37 at present as shown by a solid square, \nwhich is far from the curve; and they (M(0), say about 1000 in number, at most) can be \nneglected within some hundred thousand cities at present, if ancestors have small sizes. On \nthe other hand, we know that, size distribution for languages is not power law, for the present \ntime. Yet, they display decreasing exponential time distributions (lifetime of extinct languages \nand ages of the livings ones; disregarding the cases for small number of ancestors) similar to \nthe ones for cities. For random elimination case (punctuation) for languages (with G=0.9988, \nH=0.0022, i.e., light elimination for R= 0.0082) simple probability density function (not \nshown, similar to the one in the inset of Fig. 7) is decreasing exponential with exponent \n(about) 0.0017, where the number for the youngest languages (i.e. these emerged within the \nlast 19.2 time steps, since we divide (horizontal) time axis into equal 100 parts to calculate \nprobability) is 2430 for 1920 time steps, where decrease in the number of living ancestors in \ntime (from hundred to about ten) is observable. \n   Now, we may represent the probability (density) function by μ(τ,t), where t stands for the \nnumber of time steps, and τ stands for ages of the languages at t, and μ counts the languages \nwith age τ at t (with 0<τ ≤t). It is obvious that, the integral of μ overτ (with 0<τ ≤t) gives the \nnumber of living (not all, but) generated languages at t, which is equal to the number of total \nliving languages (M(t)) minus the number of living ancestors, and the number of living \nancestors goes zero with tÆ∞. \n   In Fig. 7 (and in many others, not shown) we observe that exponent (α, say) of μ(τ,t) is \nindependent of t, for languages and cities. Assuming that, the exponent (α=0.00185) for cities, \nwill remain as constant for tÆ∞, we may predict M(tÆ∞): A simple integration of μ(τ,t)= \nμ(1,t)exp(-ατ) over τ  (with 0<τ ≤t) can be performed for M(t), since living ancestors decay \n(in terms of fragmentation and random elimination) with time (M(t)=(μ(1,t)/α)exp(-αt)). The \ncrucial parameter for the result is μ(1,t), i.e. number of newly generated languages or newly \nestablished cities at τ=1, for each t. It is obvious that μ(1,t) can not be constant or a decreasing \nfunction with t. Because we have elimination with G<1, and number of eliminated languages \nor cities increases with t; languages change and some of them become useless, and cities \nbecome old and ruined in time. μ(1,t) may be an increasing function in time, due to non zero \nfragmentation (H). If μ(1,t) increases linearly with time we get saturation in M(tÆ∞), which \nis not contradiction, since we have elimination. If μ(1,t) increases exponentially with the \nexponent β, we have saturation in M(tÆ∞) for β =α; and we have M(tÆ∞)=0 for β <α. \nSince, we know that, at present M(t) increases with time, we may guess that α<β ; i.e., we \ninvent new languages (and establish new cities), which increase either linearly or \nexponentially (with the exponent bigger than 0.0017 for languages and bigger than 0.00185 \nfor cities) in time. One may guess that M(tÆ∞) will saturate in reality, since human \npopulation (for languages) and surface area of earth (for languages) is limited. \n   On the other hand, it is known that, cities were states in past; yet, it is not certain whether \none language was spoken per city (state), or vice versa. For the present, we have about 7000 \n \n- 8 -\nlanguages at present for a world population which is little less than 10 billion (as mentioned \nwithin the first paragraph of sect. 3.1). For the size distribution designated by number 1 \n(squares) in Fig. 6, we have about 110 thousand cities with a world population which is about \n5 billion (not shown). So, one may say that, a language is spoken within 15 city on the \naverage, at present. Yet, it is not meaningful because of several reasons; one of which is that, \nwe counted these as city, which have 626 citizens at minimum. And we do not know totally \nhow many human are living in towns and villages, etc. But, it is obvious that we have much \nmore cities than the languages in the present world. We have many metropolitan cities in the \npresent world, where only one language is spoken by big majorities. And, we have many \ncities per country, where the number of languages is smaller than the number of cities, etc. It \nis certain that, ratio of the number of total languages to that of cities is less than unity, at \npresent. \n   Thus far, we considered within various paragraphs that, languages and cities (as products of \nthe same humans) are very similar to each other in many respects. Yet, languages and cities \nare no longer the same; and for some intermediate times the cities obey the 1/size law, while \nthe languages obey the log-normal distribution, for the same (or better, similar) set of \nparameters. We predict that, log-normal size distribution may turn into power law with the \nsame, parameters if (only) the number of time steps is increased (i.e., in future). Moreover, \nlanguages and cities have (decreasing) exponential time distributions (lifetime for extinct \ncities and age for the livings ones). \n   In the next section, we will consider power law distribution for cities over size, where we \nwill utilize big number sum of (decreasing) exponential functions with independent random \nnumbers for amplitude and exponent, and show that, the sum gives power law -1. \n3.4   Sum of exponential functions with random and independent amplitude and exponent: \nLet’s consider exponential functions (zjk(x)), where the amplitude and exponent are random \nand independent; for a real or complex number b, \n \n \n \nzjk(x) = Ajexp(BBkbx)   .  \n \n \n(3) \n \nIn Eq. (3), x is any independent variable; Aj is one random number Amin≤ Aj ≤ Amax and BBk is \nanother random number Bmin\nB\n≤ BBk ≤ Bmax which are independent of each other. In other words, \nwe select A and B, from different sets of random numbers, between which there is no \nconnection. It is obvious that, real b may be taken as a scaling factor for x, or for Bk\nB ; i.e., one \nmay select b=1 for a unit of x-axis, and one may select b≠1 for a scaled unit of x-axis with \nxÆbx. And similarly; one may select b=1 for some BBmin and Bmax, and one may select b≠1 for \nBmin\nB\nÆbBmin and BBmaxÆbBmax. Now we take b in Eq. (3) as negative for positive Bk\nB , (bÆ-b), \nthus we will have negative exponents. \n   Within a system we may have several physical quantities, which vary in proportion to zjk(x), \nor to derivatives and integrals of zjk(x). Let’s consider one such function yjk(x), which is \nproportional to zjk(x), i.e., yjk(x)= zjk(x), where the constant for proportion is taken as unity, for \nsimplicity. We define, \n \nY(x)=∑j\nJ∑k\nK yjk(x)/JK   , \n \n \n \n(4) \n \nwith some big yet finite J and K, where the order of sum is not important due to independence \nof the random numbers, and random numbers are generated homogeneously.  \n   Inset of Figure 8 is for yjk(x) (Eq. (3)) with b=0.1 and Amin= Bmin =0.0, Amax = Bmax=1.0, \nwhich may be considered as size distribution for languages or cities along x-axis, where x \ncounts the agents (i.e., we place an agent (i+1) at x+1, if it is generated right after an agent (i) \nwhich is placed at x). Please note the present ancestors for small x. For the sum in Eq. (4), one \n \n- 9 -\nmay select the random numbers same for all x, and one may select new (different) random \nnumbers at each x, where all of the random numbers are completely independent (Ai is one \nrandom number, Amin≤Ai≤Amax; and BBi is another random number, Bmin\nB\n≤BBj≤Bmax\nB\n) in all. Figure \n8 displays Y(x) (Eq. (4)) with J=K=1000, for Amin= Bmin =0.0, Amax ≤1.0, Bmax≤1.0, where we \nhave no fluctuation in Y for the random numbers selected same for each x (dashed thick line) \nand fluctuation in Y increases in magnitude, as x increases (fluctuating plot) for the random \nnumbers (re-)selected for each x. And, in both cases we have power law; as the arrow with \nslope -1 indicates in log-log axes. \n   Obviously, the important issue in Fig. 8 is that Y(x) is a power function for large x with the \npower of minus unity, i.e., \n \nY(x)=∑j\nJ∑k\nK yjk(x)/JK ∝ x-1   , \n \n \n(5) \n \nwhich is similar to Pareto-Zipf law, if x stands for city population. We may state that, if the \nprobability of finding a city with population about x (say,  x±dx) decreases exponentially with \nindependent random amplitude and exponent, then the sum of mentioned probabilities gives \nthe famous power law. In other words, reason for the mentioned power law is the randomness \nin amplitude and (negative) exponent of the probability of finding a city with population \nabout x (say,  x±dx). Clearly, Eq. (5) is valid for every situation (competition between cities, \nthat between languages, and similarly between speciation and extinction, etc.), if it satisfies \nthe given conditions (i.e., random and positive amplitudes, independently random and \nnegative exponents). \n   For homogeneously (yet, independent) distributions for the random numbers Aj (for the \namplitudes) and BBk (for the exponents), with Amin≤ Aj < Amax and Bmin\nB\n≤ BBk ≤ Bmax, one may \nutilize the general theorem of central limit with large N or just convert the double sum into a \ndouble integral over A (AjÆA) and B (Bk\nB ÆB), which vary linearly (since the random numbers \nare homogeneously distributed) between the extrema to obtain the following equalities: \n \nY(x)=∑j\nJ∑k\nKyjk(x)/JK \n      ∝ – (A2\nmax – A2\nmin)[exp(–BBmaxbx) – exp(–Bmin\nB\nbx)]/(2bx)   , \n(6) \n \nand, for BBmin =0, we have  \n \nY(x) ∝ – (A2\nmax – A2\nmin)[exp(–BBmaxbx) – 1]/(2bx)   , (7) \n \nwhich may be further simplified, for 1«2bx; \n \nY(x) ∝ [(A2\nmax – A2\nmin) /2b] x –1   , \n \n(8) \n \nsince, the exponential term approaches to zero as x increases. And the result is power law, \nwith power minus one (Eq. 5). It is obvious that, BBmax may always be taken as unity, and b \nmay be varied accordingly. We may state that, our analysis (Eqs. (5)-(8)) is general for any set \nof independent random numbers for amplitudes (provided Amax and Amin is finite) and that for \nexponents (provided Bmin\nB\n= 0, where BBmax =1 may be taken after changing b accordingly). (For \nsome other applications of the present issue (in biology, for example); see, [8].) \n  As we mentioned at the beginning of this section that, b in Eqs. (3)-(8) may be real or \ncomplex. It is obvious that, for a complex (specifically, purely imaginary) b, Y(x) may be \nexpressed in terms of sinus and cosinus functions, so we get oscillatory behavior in M(t) (Eq. \n(2)) for G+H=1 for example (and, similarly, in time series for price in economy, etc.). \nFurthermore, yjk(x) in Eq. (4) may be proportional to first (second, etc) derivative of zjk(x) in \n \n- 10 -\nEq. (3), or to integral of it; where, we have more interesting cases, since then we have more \nthan two random numbers in yjk(x). We consider these cases within Appendix. \n \nAppendix \nPower law for harmonic oscillation:   For complex b (i.e., bÆ±ib), yjk(x) = Ajexp(±BBkbx), \nwhich may be re-written as a linear combination of sine and cosine; yjk(x) = Ajsin(Bk\nB bx) + \nA’jcos(BBkbx).  Then we have \n \nY(x)=∑j\nJ∑k\nK [Ajsin(BBkbx) + A’jcos(Bk\nB bx)]/JK \n  , \n(9) \n \n \nwhich is similar to Eq. (9) in [9]. It is obvious that, not Y(x) in Eq. (9) but its envelope has \npower law -1, as the following equation implies \n \nY(x) ∝ ±(A2\nmax – A2\nmin)[sin(BBmaxbx) ± cos(Bmin\nB\nbx)]/(2bx)   .  \n(10) \n \nPower law with higher power:   Now, let’s suppose that yjk(x) is proportional to d(zjk(x))/dx, \nthen we have three (at a first glance, it may be seen as two) random numbers (two of which \nare independent) in yjk(x) = bAjBBkexp(Bk\nB bx), after taking the proportionality constant as unity. \nOne may show (after a similar analysis, Eqs. (3)-(8)) that, Y(x) ∝ x–2. Similarly, if yjk(x) is \nproportional to d2(zjk(x))/dx2, then we have Y(x) ∝ x–3, etc. (For similar distribution functions \nfor price in economy; where, x stands for the relative price change (more precisely for the \nchange in the logarithm of the price) one may see [10], and relevant references therein.)  \n \n4   Discussion and conclusion: Starting with random initial conditions and utilizing many \nrandom parameters for evolution, we obtained many regularities (for size and time \ndistributions, etc.) under the process of random multiplicative noise for growth and random \nfragmentation for generation and extinction of languages or cities, with no further random \nelimination (G=1). We find that, results are independent of initial conditions, disregarding \nsome extra ordinary ones. If we have G≠1, we need longer time to mimic a target \nconfiguration, where new generated languages or cities may be inserted, in terms of \nfragmentation, provided Gcritical≤G, and 1≤G+H. Furthermore, many languages or cities \nbecome extinct in their youth and less ones become extinct as they become old. In other \nwords, languages or cities become extinct either with short lifetime (soon after their \ngeneration), or they hardly become extinct later and live long (which may be considered as a \nkind of natural selection). \n   It is known that, logistic maps (Eq. (1)) are dynamic, and under some circumstances they \nmay become chaotic. We predict that, time distribution for languages or cities are (decreasing) \nexponential and log-normal size distribution for languages at present may turn into power law \nin future. Power law -1 for size distribution of present cities, may be result of (decreasing) \nexponential distribution of their probability over size. It is worth to mention that, finite sum of \n(decreasing) exponential functions with two independent random numbers (one for the \nexponent, and one for the amplitude) may be useful to express many relevant phenomena, as \nwell in biology and economy. \n   In summary, languages and cities are not the same and for some intermediate times the \ncities obey the 1/size law, while the languages obey the log-normal distribution; where the \ndecisive parameters are fragmentation rate (H) and splitting factor (S): We have smaller (H) \nand bigger (S) for languages with respect to these for cities, for the same population growth \nrate (R, which governs the world population, which is the same for languages and cities) and \nfor the same set of other parameters. \n \n- 11 -\n \nREFERENCE LIST \n \n[1] B.F.
