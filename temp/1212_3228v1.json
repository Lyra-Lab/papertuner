Existing natural language\nprocessing techniques are either based on words as units\nor use units such as grams only for basic classiﬁcation\ntasks. How close can a machine come to reasoning about\nthe meanings of words and phrases in a corpus without\nusing any lexicon, based only on grams?\nOur own motivation for posing this question is based on\nour efforts to ﬁnd popular trends in words and phrases\nfrom online Chinese social media. This form of written\nChinese uses so many neologisms, creative character place-\nments, and combinations of writing systems that it has\nbeen dubbed the “Martian Language.” Readers must often\nuse visual queues, audible queues from reading out loud,\nand their knowledge and understanding of current events\nto understand a post. For analysis of popular trends, the\nspeciﬁc problem is that it is difﬁcult to build a lexicon when\nthe invention of new ways to refer to a word or concept\nis easy and common. For natural language processing in\ngeneral, we argue in this paper that new uses of language\nin social media will challenge machines’ abilities to operate\nwith words as the basic unit of understanding, not only in\nChinese but potentially in other languages.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nWe propose the pointillism model for natural language\nprocessing. In the proposed model, a corpus is divided\ninto grams (e.g., bigrams and trigrams in the applications\nof this model we have developed for Chinese so far),\nand words and phrases are constructed from grams\nusing external information (e.g., temporal correlations in\nthe appearance of grams). In painting, pointillism is a\ntechnique where complex scenes can be represented by\narrangements of just a few primary colors into dots. This\nis contrasted with detailed strokes using the full pallet of\ncolors. For machines, understanding a corpus as a time\nsequence of grams may be more tractable than trying\nto maintain an accurate lexicon for many applications\nand contexts. Thus, we propose the pointillism model as\nan alternative to natural language processing based on\nwords.\nAs a speciﬁc case study, in Section II we consider\nthe analysis of topical trends in Chinese social media.\nThe written form of Chinese that is used for social\nmedia contains so many neologisms, creative character\nplacements, and combinations of writing systems that\nit has been dubbed the “Martian Language.” [1], [2].\nTo evade censorship, convey special meaning, or simply\nfor creative reasons it is common for Chinese speakers\nto invent completely new ways to reference a topic\nor current event whenever they post content. This not\nonly makes it difﬁcult to build a lexicon that contains\nall possible terms, but it also exacerbates the already\ndifﬁcult task of Chinese text segmentation and means\nthat the co-occurrences of words or grams alone may\nnot be enough information to link posts about the same\ntopic.\nFigure 1 contrasts a typical traditional approach to\ntrend analysis with the pointillism approach. In a tradi-\ntional method, a lexicon is used to break the corpus up\ninto words and then the trends of words and sequences\nof words are analyzed. This requires a lexicon and a\ngood way to divide the text into words. An example\nof the pointillism approach might begin with trend\nanalysis of trigrams. Then for trigrams that appear to\nhave an interesting trend an analysis phase uses external\ninformation, such as correlations in trigram frequency\nover time, to build trending words and phrases out\nof overlapping trigrams. The main advantage of the\npointillism approach is that word segmentation and other\ntasks that require a lexicon are not necessary, meaning\nthat even corpuses with many unknown words can be\nanalyzed. A disadvantage of the pointillism approach\nis that external information is needed, in this case the\nfrequency of the appearance of trigrams with a relatively\nhigh resolution on the time scale. For these reasons,\nwhile a more traditional trend analysis may be more\nappropriate for, for example, analysis of blog posts in\nEnglish [3], we assert that the pointillism approach is\nmore effective in a different context such as the analysis\nof microblog posts in Chinese.\nIn contrast to other approaches based on grams [4],\n[5], the pointillism approach uses external information:\ndetailed timing information that contains correlations\nbased on human diurnal patterns and current events.\nMicroblog posts have a timestamp that is accurate to the\nminute or second (though, in this paper, we bin posts by\nthe hour). This timing information enables us to build\nwords and phrases out of trigrams and then group those\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\u0006\b\n\t\n\u000b\f\u0007\r\u0006\u000e\b\u000f\u0010\u000f\u0010\u0006\u000e\b\u0011\u0010\u0005\u0012\u000b\u0013\u0014\u0006\u000e\b\u0010\n\r\u0015\u0016\n\u0017\u0013\u0010\u0002\u0014\u0006\b\u000b\u0018\b\u0019\u000b\u0013\u0014\u0006\b\u000b\u0013\b\u0017\u0010\u0013\u000f\u0006\n\u001a\u0002\u000b\u0012\u0002\b\u0019\u000b\u0013\u0014\u0006\b\u001b\b\u0017\u0010\u0013\u000f\u0006\b\n\t\u0004\u0010\u001c\u0007\r\u000b\u0002\u0016\n\u0017\u0013\u0003\u0014\u0007\n\u0007\u000b\u0002\u0003\u0004\b\u0017\u0013\u0010\u0002\u0014\b\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\u0006\u001d\n\u001e\u001f\u0013\b \u0010\n!\u000b\u0014\u001d\n\u0017\u0013\u0010\u0002\u0014\u0006\b\u000b\u0018\b\"#$\u0013\u0003\u000f\u0006\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\u0006\n\u001a\u0002\u000b\u0012\u0002\b\u001b\b%\u0002\u0011\u0002\u000b\u0012\u0002\b\u0019\u000b\u0013\u0014\u0006\n\t\n\u000b\f\u0007\r\u0006\u000e\b\u000f\u0010\u000f\u0010\u0006\u000e\b\u0011\u0010\u0005\u0012\u000b\u0013\u0014\u0006\u000e\b\u0010\n\r\u0015\u0016\nFig. 1.\nChange of Order.\nFig. 2.\nTrigram trends for 中\n中\n中华\n华\n华人\n人\n人民\n民\n民共\n共\n共和\n和\n和国\n国\n国on Weibo.\nwords and phrases into topical clusters.\nFigure 2 shows an example of the temporal patterns\nthat we exploit. This is from a dataset that we are collect-\ning from Weibo, a Chinese-language microblogging site\nthat is similar to Twitter. The word we are analyzing\nin this ﬁgure is 中华人民共和国(People’s Republic\nof China). This is neither a neologism nor an unknown\nword that cannot be found in the dictionary, but it is a\ngood example of a word that can create ambiguities for\nword segmenters. Substrings of this word are themselves\nwords: 中华(alternate formal name for China), 华人\n(ethnic Chinese), 人民(the people), 中华人民(the\nChinese people), and 共和国(republic). Most individual\ncharacters in Chinese are themselves words, as well, e.g.\n人(person) or 和(and). The temporal correlations shown\nin Figure 2 exist for unknown and uncommon words, but\nwe use a common term in the ﬁgure so that the temporal\ncorrelations we refer to are illustrated for the reader.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. First\nwe present some preliminary results from an application\nof the pointillism approach in Section II, to demonstrate\nthat natural language processing tasks that go beyond\nsimple document classiﬁcations can be carried out with-\nout a lexicon. Then, in Section III, we give examples\nfrom several languages where the pointillism approach\nmay be applicable. Then we conclude with some open\nquestions and ﬁnal remarks.\nII. TREND ANALYSIS IN CHINESE SOCIAL MEDIA\nIn another paper [6], we describe the detailed algo-\nrithms we used to build a system that connects trigrams\nof Chinese characters from Weibo together into longer\nwords and phrases based on frequency correlations. Here\nwe give an example from that paper where these fre-\nquency correlations can help piece together the details of\na trending story even though only a meaningless trigram\nshowed a strong trend and posts about the event shared\nonly very common words. On 4 August 2011 the trigram\n万为开showed a strong trend. Running the algorithms\ndescribed in Song et al. [6] to ﬁnd overlapping trigrams\nwith frequency correlations gives a set of candidates that\na human can use to understand the event that lead to the\ntrend:\n100100\\_20110804\\_万为开:d: gram=万为开,\nup1conn=万为开拓团拍电视,\n(Wan made a TV program about the first\nimmigrants)\n万为开拓团纪念碑被警,\n(The statue was ... by the police)\n万为开拓团纪念碑被泼上了,\n(The statue was splashed ...)\n万为开拓团纪念碑被泼红漆,\n(The statue was splashed with red paint)\n万为开拓团纪念碑被泼红油漆,\n(The statue was splashed with red oil\npaint)\n万为开拓团纪念碑被5名男子,\n(The statue was ... by 5 men)\n万为开拓团纪念碑被5人砸,\n(The statue was defaced by 5 men)\n万为开拓团纪念碑被5人已离,\n(The statue was ... by 5 men who have\nleft)\n万为开拓团纪念碑被砸,\n(The statue was smashed)\n万为开拓团民,\n(The first immigrant people)\n万为开is a trigram which has no meaning in Chinese.\nWe caught this particular trigram out of the 323 million\ntrigrams in our database because it appeared 100 times\nmore frequently than average on 4 August 2011. After\nwe fed this trigram into a trigram connector and set the\nconnection time from 5 days before to 5 days afterward,\nwe found the phrase: 万为开拓团拍电视(Wan made\na TV program about the ﬁrst immigrants). This is still\nnot clear enough to tell us why making a TV program\ncreated a trend. However, if you read the candidate\nresults, the whole story becomes clear. It tells us that\n5 men smashed and splashed red oil paint on the statue\nof “The First Immigrants.”\nIn this event, there are many trigram words, such as\n纪念碑(statues), 开拓团(immigrants), 红油漆(red oil\npaint) and so on. However, the only trigram with a strong\ntrend was, 万为开, a meaningless trigram. In general,\nthese three characters did not appear together before\nthis event. The sudden frequency increase of this trigram\nfrom 0 helps our system notice this trigram, which lead\nus to this event. Other trigrams did not increase in rate\nas much as 万为开because of this event. This may be\nbecause they already exist and are common words and\nthus it is difﬁcult for them to have a precipitous increase\nin one day.\nAs an example of such a connection, with an improved\nalgorithm based on term frequency—inverse document\nfrequency (tf-idf), we were able to make the connection\nbetween oil prices and diesel prices in two Weibo trends\nthat were related:\n{明天油价又要涨价了,0.9515623470222634}\n(Tomorrow oil prices will again rise)\n{明天油价又要涨了,0.9359352855815268}\n(Tomorrow oil prices will again swell)\n{明天油价上涨,0.8963352077911995}\n(Tomorrow oil prices rise)\n{明天油价上涨(的),0.5048456523116667}\n(The rise of oil prices tomorrow)\n{明天油价要,0.8970978381471049}\n(Tomorrow oil prices will)\n{柴油370元和0号柴油价格,0.9035492192818616}\n(Diesel fuel 370.00 yuan diesel fuel price)\n{柴油370元和0号柴油价格(上),\n0.7128173787969483}\n(Diesel fuel 370.00 yuan diesel fuel price\nabove}\n{柴油370元和0号柴油0,0.8553821969195776}\n(Diesel fuel 370.00 yuan price)\n{柴油370元和0号汽油390,\n0.8398579004604106}\n(Diesel fuel 370.00 yuan gas 390)\n{柴油390,0.8944413356551058}\n(Diesel fuel 390)\nThe algorithms and complete results will be published\nin a future paper.\nIII. SOCIAL MEDIA EXAMPLES\nIn this section, we give some examples in various\nlanguages where approaches based on lexicons may fail.\nA. An example from Japan\nThe following example of a post from Twitter is\na mixture of English, Kanji (Chinese characters), and\nHiragana (a Japanese syllabary):\n三日更衣室で今北postしますね\nA rough translation of the post is, “I have been in\nthe dressing room for three days, can you make a post\nto explain in three lines what has been going on?” “三\n日更衣室で” is relatively straightforward Japanese text\nthat translates to, “I have been in the dressing room for\nthree days.” “今北” is a neologism that is explained in a\nblog post by Maggie Sensei [7]. “今北” is the name of a\ncompany (Imakita), but in this case serves as a neologism\nfor “今、来た三行”, which translates to “I just got\nhere, explain in three lines what has been going on.” “\n” in Japanese is pronounced “Sangyou,” but sounds like\n“三行”, or “sanggyou”, meaning “three lines.” “します\nね” is Japanese Hiragana for “make”, and “post” is an\nEnglish word.\nThis example demonstrates the ability of Japanese\nsocial media users to mix different character systems,\nplay with sounds, and combine different languages. This\ngives microblog posters great freedom of expression in\nhow they use written language to express their meaning.\nWhen the posters are using this freedom while posting\nabout current events and hot trends, natural language\nprocessing based on a lexicon may not be able to\ncategorize the topic of the post based only on the words\nin the lexicon.\nB. An example from India\nIt is very common in India to mix languages in social\nmedia posts, such as this example from Twitter that uses\na mixture of Hindi and English:\n#saale government ki #maakiaankh #kutteke bac-\nche social networking sites bandh karega ek ek\n#madharchod ka #gaand maro #bhenchod\nThis translates to:\n#Bad-boy government’s #eye-of-mother #son-of-\ndogs want social networking sites shut down each and\nevery #motherfucker’s #ass be raped #sisterfucker\nA topical analysis of social media aimed at sentiment\nanalysis would be concerned with the topic of the post\nthat the sentiment is being directed at. In this case it\nis an alleged government proposal to shut down social\nmedia sites. In this post, “government” and “social media\nsites” are in English but the words expressing the desire\nto ban these sites and the author’s sentiment towards\nthis are in Hindi. Indian social media also contains\nmany regional languages, so any sentiment analysis of\nIndian social media sites would have to incorporate many\ndifferent ways of mixing languages. Can the pointillism\napproach help in this case, or is it better to build build\na comprehensive lexicon that incorporates these many\nlanguages? We leave this as an open question.\nC. An example from China\nThe following is an excerpt from a blog post in China:\n雅青别说我粗暴，这样说也是没法子的事，现在\n的形势就是复读机，都可以填上平仄: 中南海管得了\n南海，钓鱼台管得了钓鱼岛\nThe author is using poetry and creatively pointing\nout character similarities in different words to make\na point without explicitly writing their meaning. The\nphrase is a poem and translates to, “Yaqing don’t call\nme rude, this kind of talk is also at a loss for meaning,\nthe circumstances now are a broken record, that can\nbe expressed with a poem: Zhongnanhai has authority\nover the South China Sea, Diaoyutai State Guesthouse\nhas authority over the Diaoyu islands.” Zhongnanhai is\nthe central headquarters of China’s State Council, and\nDiaoyutai State Guesthouse is a hotel where leaders of\nforeign nations stay when they visit Beijing. The author\nis expressing an opinion about a recent event in which\nChina demanded an apology from Japan over the Diaoyu\nisland dispute rather than demanding compensation. “雅\n青” is a neologism that refers to “Elegant Youth” in\ncontrast to “愤青”, which means “angry youth.” In this\ncontext “雅青” means people who would prefer a less\nmilitant solution to the Diaoyu Island dispute. “复读机”\nis a repeating machine that records audio and then plays\nit back (e.g., for use as a study aid in the classroom\nto record lectures for later review), so in this context is\nsimilar to the English phrase “broken record” in terms\nof connotations.\nWhen authors use this kind of indirect language to ex-\npress opinions about current events, the co-occurrences\nof known words and individual grams sometimes are not\nenough to adequately capture the full range of topics\ntouched on by a post. The trigram “钓鱼岛” suggests that\nthe example post is related to Diaoyu island which was\nprobably a trend at the time the post was written, but the\npost also has phrases that suggest government authority\n(“中南海管得了”), foreign inﬂuence (“钓鱼台管得了”),\na situation (“现在的形势”), and circumstances that have\nnot changed (“复读机”). Other authors will have other\nmethods for expressing these concepts. An advantage\nof the pointillism approach is that external information,\nsuch as frequency correlations in trigrams, can help to\nlink together similar concepts that are expressed in very\ndifferent ways.\nHumans are able to use their understanding of current\nevents to understand the meaning of a blog post such as\nthe example above. For natural language processing, a\nmachine lacks this contextual information but is able to\nperform calculations on how the trigrams that might be\nparts of words or phrases correlate over time in terms\nof the frequency of their usage. This information can\nserve as proxy information for context and may enable\nnatural language processing tasks to make connections\nthat go beyond co-occurrences and get closer to the\nactual meaning of social media content.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, we have given supporting evidence to\nsuggest that carrying out a natural language processing\ntask, speciﬁcally trend analysis, is possible without a\nlexicon is possible. We have also given examples in\nseveral languages where removing the dependence on\na lexicon could be beneﬁcial. Thus we propose the\npointillism approach to natural language processing as\nbeing particularly suitable for certain languages and\ncontexts.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe sould like to thank the anonymous reviewers for\nvaluable feedback.
