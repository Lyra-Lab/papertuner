Introduction\nThe given paper is devoted to logical aspects of object–oriented approach\nto create a natural language understanding system. This approach was pro-\nposed in our works [11, 12, 13].\nConsider the next tasks connected with computer understanding:\n• what the computer understanding means;\nPreprint submitted to Arxiv.org\nJune 19, 2018\n• how to realize the computer understanding;\n• how to check the accuracy of computer understanding.\nAn understanding of complete text is a thorough insight into the sense of\nassertions which are included in this text. As regards the computer under-\nstanding, it is realized with algorithms to represent the semantics of sentences\nand to check such representation.\nConsider at ﬁrst what the assertion the sense of sentence is ... means :\n1. It should be distinguished the sense for an author of information\nfrom the sense for a reader of this information as this depends on the volume\nof knowledge. Ontological and epistemological representations are as well of\ngreat importance1.\n2. The sense of sentence is contained, ﬁrstly, in the meaning of words,\nsecondly, in the functional role of these words in the sentence, thirdly, in\nproperties of objects which are known from previous sentences 2.\n3. For abstract concepts and classes of physical objects, the sense of\nwords is concluded in the standard understanding (in explanatory dictionar-\nies). For individual objects, the sense consists in properties of these objects.\nSome words have not the standard meaning (good, beauty, love), then it\nshould be took into account an emotional relation of author to their using.\n4. When we speak about the functional role of words in a sentence, we\nimply such categories as a subject, objects of inﬂuence, an action or internal\nchange of subject, other facts of the case (place, time, cause, purpose, tool\nand method of action). It should be diﬀered an object and its properties.\n5. A sentence can not be considered separately, but only in the con-\njunction with other sentences and knowledge of object domain. The sense of\nsentences has as well an implicit character which is contained in actions and\nevents following from actual information of sentences.\n1For example, consider the sentence Napoleon lost the battle of Waterloo. The name\nNapoleon can consider as the name of historical person or the name of horse. At last, it\ncan assume the migration of souls. Such distinction in semantic representation for the\nname Napoleon implies the distinction in the sense of sentence.\n2 For instance, a sentence describes actions of Peter. It is known from previous sentences\nthat Peter is unmarried. This can explain his further actions.\n2\nBy this means, the sense of sentences have objective and subjective as-\npects. It can point to three aspects [3]:\n• cognitive (propositional) - the description of facts, as well as general\nassertions following from facts;\n• communicative - the organization of text so that the accent is done on\ncertain factors of content;\n• pragmatical (illocutive) - the explanation of sentence pronouncing as\nthe action that is executed with certain purpose.\nWe limit ourselves only to cognitive (propositional) aspect. It is necessary\nto extract an objective component in the sense of declarative sentences. This\ncomponent presents the general content for a software engineer and an expert\nwhich checks the accuracy of understanding program work. To extract this\nobjective component, we assume that, ﬁrstly, both are based on certain on-\ntology and epistemology, secondly, meanings of words are understood equally\n(according to an explanatory dictionary), thirdly, both follow standard rules\nof grammar (for English see, for example, [21]).\nTo answer the question How to realize the computer understanding?, we\nmust (as noted above) be based on certain ontology and epistemology. As\nsuch basis, we use modern empiricism [23]. Empiricism is founded on modern\nphysical science concerning the structure of world and explains the reliability\nof scientiﬁc conclusions. We take the main thesis of empiricism: all synthetic\nknowledge is based on experience.\nThe world consists of physical objects, which correspond to certain do-\nmains of physical place in a given point of time. Physical objects can act or\nchange their state. These actions of objects and processes of internal state\nchange (events) are named facts. By this means, the real world consists of\nfacts. As B.Russell points, physical facts, for most part, are independent not\nonly of our volitions, but even of our existence [23, part 2, ch.11]. We de-\nscribe both real (or possible) facts and general assertions with the help of\ndeclarative sentences. The truth of concrete sentences (for real actions and\nevents) consists in the conformity with available facts. For our approach, the\nsentence of natural language is presented with a set of predicates describing\nactions, events, states, processes, persons, organizations, things, machines,\nand other classes of essences and connections.\n3\nTo answer the question How to check the accuracy of computer under-\nstanding?, it should be took into account the above determination of sense.\nTo establish the conformity of sentence sense and its semantic representation,\nit will be suﬃcient to use simple and logical questions.\nSimple questions\npermit to check the availability of all categories (subject, objects, etc) in\nrepresentations of facts. Logical questions examine the ability of computer\nsystem to do inferences on the basis of present facts and knowledge.\n2. Levels of computer understanding\nPreparatory proceeding to the computer understanding, it should be spec-\niﬁed basic principles of computer work:\n1.A computer has a timepiece. This denotes that the computer measures\na physical time.\n2. A computer permits to save numbers and symbols. Another way, the\ncomputer has a memory. On–line storage consists of cells. Each cell can save\na symbol and has a certain address. On–line storage is short–term memory.\nLong–term memory is realized using peripheral.\n3. A computer maps points on a display. Consequently, the computer\nforms points of discrete space with two coordinates.\n4. A computer executes arithmetic. Then, it can say that the computer\nunderstands what arithmetic mean.\n5. A computer moves a symbol from one address to other. This permits\nto form abstract words as sequences of symbols.\n6.\nA computer executes a program, which consists of a sequence of\ncommands. Each command contains the code of operation and addresses.\nCommands execute arithmetic, transfer of symbols, and conditional transfer.\nConditional transfer changes the sequence of command execution.\n7. A computer can ”see”, ”hear” by means of peripheral. This means\nthat the computer has perceptions.\n8. A computer (robot) can go in physical space and implement various\nphysical actions using special mechanisms.\n9. As an operation system realizes diﬀerent actions, controls programs,\nremembers all actions and events, it can speak about computer consciousness.\nThe construction of computer permitted A.Turing to express the hypoth-\nesis about the ability of computer to answer questions so that an answer\n4\nof a person and the computer can not be distinguished. Another way, the\ncomputer can understand questions and adequately answer.\nIt can distinguish four levels of computer understanding.\nAt the ﬁrst level we take into account only such grammatical categories\nas subject, objects, place and time action (event), as well as other adverbial\nmodiﬁers in a sentence. This approach is realized with syntax analysis. For\nthis level a computer system can answer simple questions. Such approach is\nof frequent use to translate from one language to other by means of computer.\nAt the second level paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations between words\nare established. Sentences are presented with semantic net where nodes have\na simple structure. Investigations in [1, 4, 6, 9, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27] relate to this\nlevel. At the second level an understanding program can answer many ques-\ntions using an inference. The understanding of semantics (for actions, events\nand physical objects) is not suﬃcient and is contained usually in inference\nrules.\nAt the third level sentences are represented with a set of predicates (the\nobject–oriented approach)[11, 12, 13]. Properties and changes of physical\nand abstract object are described with typical predicates3. Physical, physi-\nological, and psychological characteristics are estimated using special scales.\nIf measuring is executed with a physical device, then the semantics of prop-\nerty is described by physical regularities. For psychological characteristics,\nit is necessary to use algorithms of recognition. To determine economical\nactivities, special algorithms are demanded.\nAt third level there is the certain advance to describe actions and pro-\ncesses. In the work [24] the classiﬁcation of action was proposed. We use it\nin the modiﬁed view:\nPROCESS — long purposeful occupation (job, sport, studies);\nPROPEL — applying a force to an object;\nMOVE — movement of body part;\nINGEST — ingesting something inside;\nEXPEL — expelling something from a subject;\nGRASP — grasping an object;\n3Our approach is ontological.\nBased on functions, properties and structure of real\nobjects, we advert to the description of words. If we shall form a special structure (frame)\nfor every word, then we shall be at a deadlock as the variety of words is enormous. To\nsolve this problem, we use encyclopedic knowledge.\n5\nGO — displacement of subject;\nTRANSFER — change of general relation for a subject (to buy, to sell, to\ncome into fortune);\nATTEND — perceptions of subject (to see, to hear, to touch);\nMESSAGE — transmission of information between a subject and object;\nBE — identity of subject and object, existence of subject or connection be-\ntween a subject and certain class of objects;\nCHANGE — transition of subject to another internal state (event);\nCREATE — thinking (decision-making, problem-solving, prediction);\nHAVE — possession of object.\nClearly this classiﬁcation is not suﬃcient as it does not take account of\nsemantics for many verbs. To describe the semantics of simple movements\nof hand and leg, it can use cinematic equations. The complex action (for\nexample, to lead an orchestra, to play tennis, to send a message) is a sequence\nof simple movements and described with verbal deﬁnition and operation (see\nfurther). T.Winograd was a pioneer in this direction. In the work [30] virtual\nmovements of robot are realized by certain programs.\nTo represent concrete and general sentences (for a given object domain),\nwe apply a semantic net. Nodes of such net are typical predicates. This\napproach is perspective ( particularly for the great number of nodes). Firstly,\nsuch typiﬁcation of nodes simpliﬁes greatly forming of processing algorithms\nand object descriptions, secondly, the eﬀectiveness of algorithms is increased,\nthirdly, we apply encyclopedic knowledge to describe the semantics of words,\nand this extends essentially the class of solved problems.\nAt the fourth level the object–oriented approach is connected with func-\ntions of perception and physical movement. To do this, it is necessary to\ncreate a robot which has organs of sense, executes physical measurements,\nas well as realizes physical movements. The availability of recognition algo-\nrithms permits to teach such robot the cognizance of physical objects and\ndetermination of their properties. Then it can use visual determinations to\nteach basic words [23, part II-ch.2]. Other words are determined verbally.\nBesides, such robot can implement certain physical actions.\nThis speaks\nabout more deep understanding of these actions.\nSearle’s point is that the mere carrying out of a successful algorithm does\nnot in itself imply that any understanding has taken place [16, ch.1]. How-\never, at the fourth level a robot and a person overcome the same path to the\nunderstanding of that how to represent physical objects and actions (events)\n6\nassociated with words (using the realization of physical actions and recogni-\ntion algorithms of objects). Besides, the robot recognizes words of certain\nlanguage and discovers their grammatical role in a sentence, takes account\nof sense relations between words, checks the accuracy of word combinations.\nConsequently, at the fourth level there is much common in computer and\nhuman understanding although physical principles of work are diﬀerent. No\nall actions of robot can be described formally, that is, it can not be spoken\nthat the robot works only according to strict algorithms.\nThus, the fourth level permits essentially to approximate to the human\nunderstanding. However, there are open problems connected with the un-\nderstanding of such abstract concepts as good, beauty, love, truth, etc. At\nthe moment it is not clear how to do this. Some questions can be solved\nnow. For example, the program of understanding can be taught to create\nnew classes using algorithms of classiﬁcation. We can form new properties\nby means of analogous algorithms. Induction and analogy can be used to\nsolve creative tasks [17].\n3. Typical predicates to represent sentences\nTo represent concrete and general sentences, it is necessary to use the\nnext predicates for:\n• physical objects (persons, things, machines, animals, natural phenom-\nena);\n• actions and processes connected with physical objects;\n• events and states for physical objects;\n• categories connected with objects, actions and processes (time, place,\nproperty);\n• abstract objects;\n• sense relations between actions, processes, objects, events and states.\nPhysical objects are described with predicates of type ψ(u1, u2, ..., un)\nwhere u1, u2, ..., un are variables providing, in the aggregate, the identiﬁca-\ntion of object.\nFor example, it is necessary to use as such variables for\npersons: ﬁrst and second name, sex, age, place of birth, etc.\nA concrete\n7\nobject is presented by means of substitution of individual constants instead\nvariables. Each real object is characterized by a compact connected domain\nof physical space at a given point of time. Points of this domain have coordi-\nnates (x1, x2, x3), as well as physical parameters (mass, charge, temperature,\netc)[2, App.A]. The predicate ψ is true during a certain interval of time if a\nreal object exists in this interval.\nCategories connected with objects, actions and processes are presented\nwith predicates of type δ(y1, y2, ..., yn) where y1, y2, ..., yn are variables pro-\nviding, in the aggregate, the identiﬁcation of given category. As categories,\nwe consider a time, place, and property of object.\nConcrete category is\nformed by means of substitution of individual constants instead variables.\nEvery real time is characterized by an interval of physical time, the place\ncorresponds to a domain of physical space with coordinates (x1, x2, x3). The\nproperty of physical object is a characteristic conditioned by the physical\nand psychological regularities.\nSense relations between objects are described with predicates of type\nµ(q1, q2, ..., qn) where q1, q2, ..., qn are variables. Abstract objects correspond\nto predicates of type ρ(r1, r2, ..., rn) where r1, r2, ..., rn are variables. A con-\ncrete sense relation (abstract object) is formed using the substitution of in-\ndividual constants instead variables.\nActions (processes) connected with physical objects are presented with\npredicates of type ϕ(v1, v2, ..., vn) where v1, v2, ..., vn are variables providing,\nin the aggregate, the identiﬁcation of given action or process. As such vari-\nables, we use a subject, objects of inﬂuence, time and place of action, as well\nas other facts of the case. As these factors correspond to other predicates, to\npoint to them, we use unique codes appointed these predicates. A concrete\naction (process) is described using the substitution of individual constants\ninstead variables. A real action (process) is characterized by a set of compact\nconnected domains in a physical space–time4. Each such domain consists of\npoints with coordinates (x1, x2, x3, t) and physical parameters. The predicate\nϕ is true in a certain interval of time if a set of domains corresponds to a real\n(i.e., checked) fact. A place of action (process) embraces domains of subject,\nobjects of inﬂuence in physical space with coordinates (x1, x2, x3) during a\ngiven interval of time.\n4Hereafter we are dealing with classical (Galilean) space–time[16, ch.5]. For the object\ndomain connected with social system, it is suﬃcient.\n8\nEvents (states) connected with physical objects are presented with predi-\ncates of type γ(w1, w2, ..., wn) where w1, w2, ..., wn are variables providing, in\nthe aggregate, the identiﬁcation of this event and state. As such variables,\nwe use codes of subject, objects of inﬂuence, time and place, etc. A concrete\nevent (state) is described using the substitution of individual constants in-\nstead variables. Each real event (state) is characterized by a set of compact\nconnected domains in a physical space–time. Each domain contains points\nwith coordinates (x1, x2, x3, t) and physical parameters. The predicate γ is\ntrue in a certain interval of time if a set of domains corresponds to a real fact.\nA place of event (state) embraces domains of subject, objects of inﬂuence in\nphysical space with coordinates (x1, x2, x3) during a given interval of time.\nGo on now to the detailed description of above types of predicates. Only\nafter that we can consider the formal representation for concrete and general\nsentences. Values of variables, as a rule, correspond to names of variables,\notherwise these values are explained. If we speak about the type of some-\nthing, this means that values of variables are divided into several classes. As\nan illustration, we can point to some names of classes. Codes of objects,\naction, events and states included in descriptions of predicates pose refer-\nences to these objects, actions, events and states. These references present\nsemantic relations between objects, actions, events and states.\n3.1.

Typical predicates of states and events\nA change of internal state (for a physical object) is referred to as an\nevent. States and events of persons, organization, machines, things, animals,\nnatural phenomena are described using the predicate event. This predicate\n15\ntakes the form:\nevent (cod evt, sort evt, neg evt, tense, char evt, adverb, word, cod sub, cod obj,\nscale, beg state, res state, cod time, cod loc, cod cause)\nwhere cod evt is a code of event (state), sort evt is a kind of event (state)\n(real, possible, necessary), neg evt denotes the negation of event (state), tense\nis a grammatical tense, char evt is a character of event (state) (complete,\nincomplete), adverb is an adverb which is used to estimate this event (state),\nword is a verb describing this event (state), cod sub is a code of subject for\nthis event (state), cod obj is a code of inﬂuence object, scale denotes a scale\n(see above), beg state is a start state (pointed by a value of scale), res state\nis a ﬁnal state, cod time is a code of time (for this event or state), cod loc is\na code of place (for this event or state), cod cause is a code of cause (for this\nevent or state).\n4. A database\nA database contains a set of typical predicates describing facts (after\nthe substitution of individual constants instead variables). The database in-\ncludes such predicates: person, organization, thing, machine, animal, abstr,\nnature, action, process, event, message, thought, property, number, place,\ntime, cause, relation, link.\nBesides, the database contains dictionaries of\nparadigms, verbs and nouns5.\n4.1. A dictionary of paradigms\nTo represent a dictionary of paradigms, we use the predicate:\nparadigm (cod par, osn form, paradigm, gram cat, synt char)\nwhere cod par is a code of paradigm, osn form is a basic form of word,\ngram cat is a grammatical category, synt char is a syntax characteristic.\nA basic form is a basic word in dictionaries. It can be several descriptions\nwith the same basic form to present all paradigms for all parts of speech. A\ngrammatical category points to belonging to a certain part of speech (noun,\n5Described further project solutions are oriented to English. For other languages, these\nsolutions must be modiﬁed.\n16\nverb, adverb, etc). A syntax characteristic describes a syntax function of\ngiven word in a sentence. For example, an adverb can be the next sorts:\nplace, time, degree, manner.\n4.2. A dictionary of nouns\nTo represent a dictionary of nouns6, we use the predicate:\nnoun (cod int, osn form, gram cat, maj class, sem cod, verb, scale, state,\ncombin )\nwhere cod int is an unique code, osn form is a basic form of word, gram cat\nis a grammatical category (noun or adjective), maj class is a generic class,\nsem cod is a semantic code, verb is a corresponding verb for verbal noun,\nscale denotes a scale (see above), state is a state pointed by a value of scale,\ncombin describes the compatibility of nouns.\nThe variable sem cod has the next values: person, prof (profession), sibl\n(sibling connection), org (organization), anim(animal), plant, place, time,\nthing, weapon , mach (machine), occup (occupation), event, state, prop (prop-\nerty), body , natur (natural phenomenon), mat (matter), env (environment),\npsych (psychic process or action), mes (message), act (physical action of\nperson), abstr\n(abstract concept), scale, cloth, food, quant\n(attribute of\nquantity).\nThe description of compatibility for nouns connected by means of preposi-\ntions permits to point to admissible combinations of preposition and semantic\ncode (for example, for the word book: on thing, on abstr, of person, of org).\n4.3. A dictionary of verbs\nThe predicate of this dictionary is of the form:\nverb (cod verb, inf, after verb, sem typ, scale, beg state, end state, subj, contr at,\ncontr from, contr to, contr with)\nwhere cod verb is a code of verb, inf is a basic form (Inﬁnitive), after verb is\nan adverbial particle, sem typ is a semantic type of verb (PROPEL, MOVE,\nGO, etc), beg state is a start state (pointed by a value of scale) as a result\nof action, end state is a ﬁnal state, subj is semantic codes of subject (see the\n6Besides nouns, this dictionary contains as well adjectives.\n17\ndescription of the predicate noun), contr at is the description of control in the\nconstruction AT, contr to is the description of control in the construction TO,\ncontr from is the description of control in the construction FROM, contr with\nis the description of control in the construction WITH.\nThe description of control in the construction AT is used to point to\nsemantic codes of noun realizing a direct object (see the description of the\npredicate noun). The control in the construction FROM characterizes an in-\ndirect object from which an action is transferred. To do this, it is necessary\nto point to admissible combinations of preposition and semantic code (for\nexample, for the verb get: from person, from org). The control in the con-\nstruction TO presents an indirect object to which an action is directed. To\ndo this, it is necessary as well to point to admissible combinations of prepo-\nsition and semantic code (for example, for the verb put: on mach, on body,\nto thing). The control in the construction WITH describes possible tools and\nmethods to realize the given action.\nFor example, for the verb shoot (in the meaning kill):\ninf\nshoot\nsem type\nPROPEL\nscale\nHEALTH\nbeg state\n+50\nend state\n-100\nsubj\nperson\ncontr at\nperson\ncontr with\nweapon\nDepending on the sense, a verb can have several descriptions in the dic-\ntionary verb.\nThe dictionary maps the admissible compatibility of subject and objects\nwith the character of action 7. This permits to eliminate the semantic ambi-\nguity for verbs(nouns) and to determine nonsensical sentences (see further).\n7The analogous approach was proposed in [9] using the concept of semantic valence.\nThe dependence of subject and objects on the type of verb is considered as well in works\nof Katz-Fodor [8].\n18\n5. Semantic representations of sentences using typical predicates\nTo represent every sentence, one must execute semantic descriptions:\n• groups of nouns;\n• simple sentences;\n• compound and complex sentences.\nThe semantic representation is based on syntax analysis of sentence. The\ndescription of grammar is executed by means of Backus-Naur form[11] .\n5.1. Semantic representations of noun groups\nSubjects, objects, adverbial modiﬁers are described using a group of noun.\nConsider a simple group of noun including a basic noun and attributes. At\nthe beginning of group a preposition can be. If the basic noun describes a\nphysical or abstract object, then this noun is transformed to the predicate\nof type: person, animal, organization, thing, machine, nature, abstr.\nTo\ndetermine the type of predicate, the semantic code of this noun (pointed in\nthe dictionary of nouns) is used. A verbal noun is considered in association\nwith an action or event described in a given sentence(see further).\nIf the basic noun poses a time or place, it is necessary to take account of\na preposition. In this case, the noun is transformed to the predicate of type:\ntime, place.\nBy means of article the individualizing character of basic noun is de-\ntermined. If the attribute of basic noun is a property, then the predicate\nproperty is formed for this attribute. If the attribute is a participle, then the\npredicate of action or event is built. If nouns are used as attribute, then it\ncan consider such group as an extended group of noun (see further).\nWhen the group of noun is analysed, the identiﬁcation of objects is exe-\ncuted. The identiﬁcation permits to establish the identity of objects. Algo-\nrithms of identiﬁcation are considered in [12]. If an identical object already\nexists for the given basic noun, then the new predicate is not formed, and\nonly the available predicate is modiﬁed.\nTo analyse an extended group of noun (connecting simple groups of nouns\nusing prepositions), rules of compatibility for nouns are used (see the dictio-\nnary of nouns). If a noun denoting a property is connected with other noun\nusing the preposition of, then the predicate property is formed for the ﬁrst\n19\nand pointed to this property in the second.\nIf the preposition of is used\nto present an owner of thing or machine, then this owner is pointed in the\npredicate thing or machine. In other cases, rules of compatibility are used.\nThe connection between simple groups of nouns is realized with the predicate\nrelation.\n5.2. Semantic representations of simple sentences\nAn analysed text is divided into fragments. Each fragment is character-\nized by unity of place and time. All actions or events of fragment are executed\nduring a certain interval of time. The place and time are described usually in\nthe ﬁrst sentences. According to the principle of coherence [8, sec.9-2], these\nplace and time, as a rule, are not pointed in following sentences. Then to\nform the semantic representation for these sentences, the earlier–described\nplace and time are used. Personal, demonstrative and possessive pronouns\npose references to earlier–described actions, processes, events, states and ob-\njects. Indeﬁnite pronouns point to the existential quantiﬁer (some, any) and\nthe universal quantiﬁer (all, every, each) [23, part II,ch.10].\nConsider the semantic representation of simple declarative sentence. Af-\nter the semantics of a subject, objects, place, time, other adverbial modiﬁers\nis described, to represent the semantics of sentence, it is necessary to form\nthe semantic description of actions, processes, events, states. To do this,\nthe analysis of predicate (in grammatical sense) is executed. The following\npredicates are formed as a result of semantic analysis: action — for physi-\ncal actions, message — for the transmission of information, thought — for\nfeelings and thoughts, process — for long goal–seeking occupations, event —\nfor events and states. The choice of predicate is based on the indication of\nsemantic type in the dictionary of verbs.\nForming of semantic predicates describing actions and events is reduced\nto the determination of factors which are typical for these actions and events:\n• subject of action (event);\n• objects which take part in the transmission of information or action;\n• location and time of action (event);\n• purpose (result) and method (tool) of action (event).\nSemantic roles of indirect objects and adverbial modiﬁers are determined\nusing prepositions for noun groups.\n20\nTo overcome the problem of ambiguous expressions, we select a semantic\nvariant corresponding to one of the descriptions of the given verb (in the\ndictionary of verbs). For example, consider the sentence A man works with\nmagnetic ﬁeld. As the verb work is combined with the abstract object ﬁeld\nusing the preposition with, it can eliminate the meaning describing the place\nof action.\nNonsensical sentences are found as well using the dictionary of verbs.\nFor instance, consider the sentence A man plays physic. The word physic\nis inadmissible as the verb play is not combined with the object denoting\nscience.\nParadigmatic relations between words of sentences ( see [3]) are described\nin a knowledge base and dictionaries of database. For a concrete sentence,\nthese relations are presented by means of the predicate relation. Syntag-\nmatic relations are pointed using connections between actions (events) and\nsubjects, objects, adverbial modiﬁers. Such connections are formed by means\nof references in predicates action, message, thought, process, event(codes of\nsubject, objects, time, place, etc).\n5.3. Semantic representations of compound and complex sentences\nA complex declarative sentence includes clauses, participle and inﬁnitive\nconstructions. For each clause and construction, the same algorithm is used\nas for a simple sentence. The connection between the main sentence and\nsubordinate constructions is realized with the predicate link.\nA compound sentence consists of several simple and complex sentences.\nThe connection between independent sentences is described with the predi-\ncate link.\n6. A knowledge base\nTo form answers for logical questions, it is necessary to have the dictio-\nnary containing explanations of words.\nThis dictionary is realized as the\nknowledge base[11, 13]. The knowledge base consists of the predicates tper-\nson, taction, torganization,... which have precisely the same structure as\nappropriate predicates of database (person, action, organization,...). Build-\ning the knowledge base is founded on algorithms of syntax and semantic\nanalysis described in [11].\n21\nThere is the set of words whose sense is implied in the system and realized\nby appropriate algorithms. All other words are explained by means of knowl-\nedge base. These explanations pose practically semantic(verbal) deﬁnitions\nof words.\nThe knowledge base includes the next descriptions:\n• general properties of physical and abstract objects;\n• general properties of actions, processes, and events;\n• operations and scripts;\n• schemas and plans.\nThere is a special article (fragment) in the knowledge base for each de-\nscription of concept. We limit ourselves to the description of general prop-\nerties (for physical and abstract objects, actions, processes, events and op-\nerations). The description of scripts, schemas, and plans is considered in\n[13]. Previously, we discuss the problem of primitives — the use of minimum\ndictionary to explain words [23, part II]8.\nThe minimum dictionary contains such classes of words to present:\n• types of objects (person, organization, place, people, animal, plant,...);\n• semantic role of words in sentence (subject, object, way, tool, place,\ntime, property, cause, purpose, ...);\n• basic actions, processes and events (be, go, move, message, transfer,\ncreate, attend, thought, consist, ...);\n• the direction of moving (top, down, left, right);\n• scales (color, length, weight,...);\n• abstract concepts (part, whole, knowledge, decision, analysis,...);\n8The problem of primitives is considered in [29]. Ch.K.Ogden had proposed the mini-\nmum dictionary of English including 850 words. If the control problem for complex social\nsystems is considered as the object domain, then the correction of this dictionary is de-\nmanded.\n22\n• physical concepts (force, velocity,...);\n• mathematical concepts (number, set, point, line, plane,...).\nIt should be emphasized that primitives are words having monosemantic,\nintuitively obvious meaning. Such parts of speech as conjunction, preposi-\ntion, pronoun, particle are included as well in the number of primitives.\nTo ﬁnd primitives for a set of words S (describing an object domain),\neach deﬁnition will be presented as Subject+Predicate where Subject is a\ndetermined word, Predicate contains a generic concept and diﬀerence. If A\nand B are nonintersecting sets of words, then A(B) means that the set of\nwords A is determined by means of the set of words B.\n.\nDeﬁnition 1. Let S is a set of words, S0, S1, S2, ..., Sn are subsets of S so\nthat Si ∩Sj = ⊘, i, j = 0, ..., n, i ̸= j, S = S0 ∪S1 ∪S2 ∪... ∪Sn. Assume that\nS1(S0), S2(S0 ∪S1), S3(S0 ∪S1 ∪S2), ..., Sn(S0 ∪S1 ∪S2... ∪Sn−1). Then S0\nis the set of primitives for S.\nIt is easy to verify that if S\n′ ⊃S, then for S\n′ the set of primitives S\n′\n0\nexists so that S0 ⊆S\n′\n0. Another way, each word in the object domain can be\ndetermined using primitives.\nThe general purpose of deﬁnitions is to explain the sense of words. This\npermits to solve logical questions, which demand the analysis of connec-\ntions between concepts[13].\nIt does not mean that we shall go the chain\nSj1, Sj2, Sj3, ..., S0 in the reverse order (j1 > j2 > j3 > ... > 0 ) completely.\nFor most calls to the knowledge base, it is suﬃcient to establish the confor-\nmity with available facts 9.\n6.1. An article of noun\nAn article of noun describes general properties of physical or abstract\nobject. To form the article of noun (for example, doctor), at ﬁrst the phrase\nof this kind is entered: frame is a doctor.\nThen functions of this noun are indicated:\n9 For instance, it is necessary to check the availability of weapon for a person. It is\nknown that this person has a pistol. The deﬁnition of pistol says that a pistol is a weapon\nwhich is kept in hand. It is suﬃcient for the check.\n23\ndoctor examines a person\ndoctor determines a disease\ndoctor prescribes a medicine\nThe structure of object (for example, for the noun car) is formed by means\nof the phrase:\nA car consists of chassis, engine,...\n6.2. An article of verb\nAn article of verb describes general properties of actions, processes, and\nevents. To form the article of verb (for example, to go on), the phrase of\ntype frame is to go on is entered. To describe diﬀerent values of verb, the\ngroup of noun can be used in addition:\nframe is to shoot from a gun\nframe is to shoot a person\nThen semantic deﬁnitions and descriptions of concrete actions are en-\ntered.\nFor example, after the phrase frame is to learn, there will be the\ndescriptions:\nto do exercises\nto answer a teacher\nto visit a lesson in a class\nto study a textbook\nAfter semantic deﬁnitions, motives and causes of action can be described.\nFor example, after the phrase frame is to shoot a person, there will be the\nexpressions:\nto kill the person by gun\nto get money from the person as a subject is criminal\nto pay oﬀthe person as this person outrages a subject\nto annihilate the person as this person is the enemy of a subject\n6.3. An article of operation\nAn operation is a sequence of actions to execute a certain purpose. The\nalgorithm of operation is based on principles of production systems [7]. All\n24\nconscious human activity includes the set of diﬀerent operations planed be-\nforehand and modiﬁed in the course of realization.\nThe description of operation can involve several alternatives. Each alter-\nnative is entered with a separate article. For example, for the purpose how\nto rob an organization one can indicate the following description of the ﬁrst\nalternative:\nframe is how to rob an organization\nalternative 1 ; to go to the organization\nalternative 1 ; to come in\nalternative 1 ; to neutralize personal\nalternative 1 ; to open safes using tools\nalternative 1 ; to take moneys and things\nalternative 1 ; to come out\nThe above sequence of actions consists of stages. Each stage can contain\nan action, object of inﬂuence, motive and cause, condition and way (tool) of\naction.\n7. The comparison with other approaches to analysis of language\nLet us compare the proposed approach with other approaches to semantic\nanalysis of language. We limit ourselves to the most advanced and widely\nknown researches.\nThe most deep investigations of semantics (it is our opinion) are based\non the representation of objects, events, processes and actions in the view of\nframes [10, 19, 20, 27]. Firstly, this approach is adequate ours in the sense\nthat the representation of semantics (for objects, states, events, actions, and\nprocesses) is equivalent ours.\nSecondly, for long-term saving of the great\nvolume of information, it is necessary to use modern databases, i.e., we arrive\nagain at predicates. Thirdly, the description of frame structures is a laborious\nprocess taking into account the great variety of objects, states, events, and\nactions. The essential distinction of our approach implies that we use typical\npredicates and verbal deﬁnitions from encyclopedias.\nThe conceptual approach has gained wide acceptance [4, 22, 24, 25, 26].\nThe main imperfection of this approach is that objects, states, events, actions\nand processes have not adequate and detailed semantic description. There\nis only the typiﬁcation of action. This simpliﬁes realization, but essentially\n25\nconstricts an area of solved tasks.\nThe Russian school of semantics has gained essential successes[1, 6, 9, 28].\nThe main feature of these works consists in the limitation of language aspects\n— paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations between words [3, ch.1]. This\ndoes not permit to describe the functional purpose and structure of physical\nand abstract object, as well as the functional role and complex character of\naction and processes. Of particular interest is the work [18]. To describe facts\nand knowledge, the simple semantic net is applied — each node is a word.\nThis does not permit to discover in full measure the semantics of words and\nsentences. To present processes, in this work scripts were proposed.\n8. A formal logic system\nThe computer system for natural language understanding can be consid-\nered as a formal logic system S which is presented by the tuple:\nS =< A, B, Φ, Σ, Ω>,\n(1)\nwhere A is an alphabet, B is a set of atomic propositions, Φ is a set of\nfunctions, Σ are rules of inference, Ωis a set of Horn’s formulas (clauses).\nThe alphabet consists of letters, ciphers, special signs.\nSymbols are\nformed from letters. Variables, individual constants, names of function and\npredicates are pointed using symbols. A term is an individual constant, vari-\nable or expression f(t1, t2, ..., tn) where ti is a term, f is a functional symbol.\nThe atomic proposition P(t1, t2, ..., tn) is formed from the predicate sym-\nbol P and a list of terms.\nIf terms do not contain variables, the atomic\nproposition is called an atom.\nAs well–formed formulas, only Horn’s clauses are used[5]:\nPj ←Qj\n1, Qj\n2, ..., Qj\nn, j = 1, ..., m,\n(2)\nwhere Pj and Qj\ni are atomic propositions.\nAtoms and Horn’s clauses execute the function of axioms. Rules of infer-\nence use the principle of resolution and the algorithm of uniﬁcation [5]. It\ncan prove that every algorithm can be realized using this formal system.\nThe semantic interpretation of the formal system S is the tuple:\nI =< D, If, IP >,\n(3)\n26\nwhere D is the domain of interpretation including ranges of variables for\npredicates and functions. D consists of sets of integer and real numbers, as\nwell as sets of abstract words in the alphabet A. Each individual constant is\nconnected with a certain value of variable. If is the map of sort:\nIf(f) : Mn →M\n(4)\nfor each function f where M is a set from D. IP is the map of sort:\nIP(P) : M1 ∗M2 ∗... ∗Mn →{true, false}\n(5)\nfor each predicate P where Mi is a range of a variable with the index i for\nthis predicate. This range is included as well in D.\nEach concrete real object is characterized by a compact connected domain\nof physical space at a given point of time and described by the above predicate\nψ (after the substitution of individual constants instead variables).\nThe\nintension of ψ is the aggregate of properties described by means of variables\nof this predicate, the extension of ψ is the set of real objects corresponding to\nthis predicate [2, ch.1]. The above predicates ϕ and γ (after the substitution\nof individual constants instead variables) correspond to a set of compact\nconnected domains in a physical space–time (for real actions and events).\nThe predicates ψ, ϕ and γ can use to describe possible objects, actions and\nevents. For example, it is necessary for future time.\nDeﬁnition 2. The aggregate P = {Mψ, Mϕ, Mγ, Mδ, Mµ, Mρ} is called the\nsemantic representation of a declarative sentence if Mψ is the set of predi-\ncates ψ corresponding to physical objects from this sentence, Mϕ is the set\nof predicates ϕ presenting actions and processes of the given sentence, Mγ is\nthe set of predicates γ describing events or states for objects of this sentence,\nMµ is the set of predicates µ corresponding to sense relations between objects\nfrom this sentence, Mδ is the set of predicates δ corresponding to categories\nconnected with objects, actions and processes of the given sentence, Mρ is the\nset of predicates ρ pointing to abstract objects from this sentence.\nFor a concrete declarative sentence describing a real (i.e., checked) or pos-\nsible (i.e., unchecked) fact, individual constants must be substituted instead\nvariables in predicates Mψ, Mϕ, Mγ, Mδ, Mµ, Mρ. The extension of P is the\nvalue of truth for the given sentence [2, ch.1]. If the sentence describes a real\nfact, then it is true. The intension of P (in this case) is the real fact corre-\nsponding to a set of compact connected domains in a physical space–time.\n27\nConsider a general synthetic sentence presented by means of P. If this\nsentence summarizes facts using the universal and existential quantiﬁer, then\nthe veriﬁcation of a such sentence can be a hard problem [23, part 2, ch.10].\nIn this case, the intension is the uniﬁcation of facts.\nThe algorithm of forming P is realized in the system LEIBNIZ using the\nlanguage PROLOG[11]. This language includes Horn’s clauses and atomic\npropositions. An inference is executed with the help of resolution principle\nand uniﬁcation algorithm. To check the accuracy of semantic representation,\nsimple and logic questions are applied[12, 13].\n9. Conclusion\nThe proposed object–oriented approach poses the essential advance to\nsolve the computer understanding problem. The representation of facts and\nknowledge using typical predicates permits greatly to simplify algorithms of\nprocessing and object descriptions. Besides, the eﬀectiveness of processing\nis increased. This is of great importance for the object domain having the\nlarge quantity of words. The main feature of our approach (as compared with\nother investigations) is in the use of encyclopedic knowledge. This permits\nessentially to extend the class of solved problems.\nUsing the proposed technology, new principles of control for complex so-\ncial systems can be realized: both for enterprise and state structures. For\nexample, consider the problem of enterprise management. At the moment\nthe technology ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) is applied. A new tech-\nnology (in addition to ERP) is focused on ensuring of proﬁt increase and\nnormal cash ﬂow[14, 15]. This technology involves the next functions: form-\ning of intellectual interface on a natural language to communicate with a\ncontrol system; joint planning of production and sales to get the maximal\nproﬁt; an adaptation of control system to internal and external events.\nOther example concerns the domain of criminology. Living computer sys-\ntems save information about criminal oﬀences by means of databases. How-\never, this information can not be used in full measure for logical processing as\nalgorithms of semantic analysis are not applied in such systems. Thus, many\nactual problems are solved only by criminalists. Proposed algorithms permit\nto create more intellectual systems based on methods of criminalistics. Such\nsystems will form answers for natural language questions about criminal of-\nfences using the purposeful selection from a database and logical processing\nof selected data. If at ﬁrst the great selection from the database is demanded,\n28\nthen it can gain serious results, which it can not get by other means. Some\nalgorithms of such task solution are considered in the paper[13].\nBy this means, the presented technology discovers the perspective for\nthe successful solution of problems in the social domains with the help of\nintellectual computer systems. We shall name this direction of investigations\nas computer semantics. Computer semantics is the part of cybernetics that\nstudies questions connected with the application of semantic representations\n(for expressions of natural language) to control problems.\nReferences\n[1] Ju.D.Apresjan and oth., Linguistic processor for complex information\nsystem, Nauka, Moscow, 1992\n[2] R.Carnap, Meaning and Necessity, Ch., 1956.\n[3] I.M.Cobozeva, Linguistic semantics, LIBROCOM, Moscow, 2012.\n[4] W.G.Lehnert, M.G.Dyer , P.N.Johnson, C.J.Yang , S.Harley, BORIS - An\nExperiment in-Depth Understanding of Narratives, Artiﬁcial Intelligence,\nvol.20, 1, 1983.\n[5] R.Kowalski, Logic for Problem Solving, Elsevier North Holland, 1979.\n[6] N.N.Leont’eva, Automatic understanding of texts: systems, models, re-\nsources, Academia, Moscow, 2006.\n[7] G.F.Luger, Artiﬁcial Intelligence.
