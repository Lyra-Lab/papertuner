Most successful RL applica-\ntions that operate on these domains have relied on hand-crafted features combined with linear value\nfunctions or policy representations. Clearly, the performance of such systems heavily relies on the\nquality of the feature representation.\nRecent advances in deep learning have made it possible to extract high-level features from raw sen-\nsory data, leading to breakthroughs in computer vision [11, 22, 16] and speech recognition [6, 7].\nThese methods utilise a range of neural network architectures, including convolutional networks,\nmultilayer perceptrons, restricted Boltzmann machines and recurrent neural networks, and have ex-\nploited both supervised and unsupervised learning. It seems natural to ask whether similar tech-\nniques could also be beneﬁcial for RL with sensory data.\nHowever reinforcement learning presents several challenges from a deep learning perspective.\nFirstly, most successful deep learning applications to date have required large amounts of hand-\nlabelled training data. RL algorithms, on the other hand, must be able to learn from a scalar reward\nsignal that is frequently sparse, noisy and delayed. The delay between actions and resulting rewards,\nwhich can be thousands of timesteps long, seems particularly daunting when compared to the direct\nassociation between inputs and targets found in supervised learning. Another issue is that most deep\nlearning algorithms assume the data samples to be independent, while in reinforcement learning one\ntypically encounters sequences of highly correlated states. Furthermore, in RL the data distribu-\ntion changes as the algorithm learns new behaviours, which can be problematic for deep learning\nmethods that assume a ﬁxed underlying distribution.\nThis paper demonstrates that a convolutional neural network can overcome these challenges to learn\nsuccessful control policies from raw video data in complex RL environments. The network is\ntrained with a variant of the Q-learning [26] algorithm, with stochastic gradient descent to update\nthe weights. To alleviate the problems of correlated data and non-stationary distributions, we use\n1\narXiv:1312.5602v1  [cs.LG]  19 Dec 2013\nFigure 1: Screen shots from ﬁve Atari 2600 Games: (Left-to-right) Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders,\nSeaquest, Beam Rider\nan experience replay mechanism [13] which randomly samples previous transitions, and thereby\nsmooths the training distribution over many past behaviors.\nWe apply our approach to a range of Atari 2600 games implemented in The Arcade Learning Envi-\nronment (ALE) [3]. Atari 2600 is a challenging RL testbed that presents agents with a high dimen-\nsional visual input (210 × 160 RGB video at 60Hz) and a diverse and interesting set of tasks that\nwere designed to be difﬁcult for humans players. Our goal is to create a single neural network agent\nthat is able to successfully learn to play as many of the games as possible. The network was not pro-\nvided with any game-speciﬁc information or hand-designed visual features, and was not privy to the\ninternal state of the emulator; it learned from nothing but the video input, the reward and terminal\nsignals, and the set of possible actions—just as a human player would. Furthermore the network ar-\nchitecture and all hyperparameters used for training were kept constant across the games. So far the\nnetwork has outperformed all previous RL algorithms on six of the seven games we have attempted\nand surpassed an expert human player on three of them. Figure 1 provides sample screenshots from\nﬁve of the games used for training.\n2\nBackground\nWe consider tasks in which an agent interacts with an environment E, in this case the Atari emulator,\nin a sequence of actions, observations and rewards. At each time-step the agent selects an action\nat from the set of legal game actions, A = {1, . . . , K}. The action is passed to the emulator and\nmodiﬁes its internal state and the game score. In general E may be stochastic. The emulator’s\ninternal state is not observed by the agent; instead it observes an image xt ∈Rd from the emulator,\nwhich is a vector of raw pixel values representing the current screen. In addition it receives a reward\nrt representing the change in game score. Note that in general the game score may depend on the\nwhole prior sequence of actions and observations; feedback about an action may only be received\nafter many thousands of time-steps have elapsed.\nSince the agent only observes images of the current screen, the task is partially observed and many\nemulator states are perceptually aliased, i.e. it is impossible to fully understand the current situation\nfrom only the current screen xt. We therefore consider sequences of actions and observations, st =\nx1, a1, x2, ..., at−1, xt, and learn game strategies that depend upon these sequences. All sequences\nin the emulator are assumed to terminate in a ﬁnite number of time-steps. This formalism gives\nrise to a large but ﬁnite Markov decision process (MDP) in which each sequence is a distinct state.\nAs a result, we can apply standard reinforcement learning methods for MDPs, simply by using the\ncomplete sequence st as the state representation at time t.\nThe goal of the agent is to interact with the emulator by selecting actions in a way that maximises\nfuture rewards. We make the standard assumption that future rewards are discounted by a factor of\nγ per time-step, and deﬁne the future discounted return at time t as Rt = PT\nt′=t γt′−trt′, where T\nis the time-step at which the game terminates. We deﬁne the optimal action-value function Q∗(s, a)\nas the maximum expected return achievable by following any strategy, after seeing some sequence\ns and then taking some action a, Q∗(s, a) = maxπ E [Rt|st = s, at = a, π], where π is a policy\nmapping sequences to actions (or distributions over actions).\nThe optimal action-value function obeys an important identity known as the Bellman equation. This\nis based on the following intuition: if the optimal value Q∗(s′, a′) of the sequence s′ at the next\ntime-step was known for all possible actions a′, then the optimal strategy is to select the action a′\n2\nmaximising the expected value of r + γQ∗(s′, a′),\nQ∗(s, a) = Es′∼E\nh\nr + γ max\na′ Q∗(s′, a′)\n\f\f\fs, a\ni\n(1)\nThe basic idea behind many reinforcement learning algorithms is to estimate the action-\nvalue function,\nby using the Bellman equation as an iterative update,\nQi+1(s, a)\n=\nE [r + γ maxa′ Qi(s′, a′)|s, a]. Such value iteration algorithms converge to the optimal action-\nvalue function, Qi →Q∗as i →∞[23]. In practice, this basic approach is totally impractical,\nbecause the action-value function is estimated separately for each sequence, without any generali-\nsation. Instead, it is common to use a function approximator to estimate the action-value function,\nQ(s, a; θ) ≈Q∗(s, a). In the reinforcement learning community this is typically a linear function\napproximator, but sometimes a non-linear function approximator is used instead, such as a neural\nnetwork. We refer to a neural network function approximator with weights θ as a Q-network. A\nQ-network can be trained by minimising a sequence of loss functions Li(θi) that changes at each\niteration i,\nLi (θi) = Es,a∼ρ(·)\nh\n(yi −Q (s, a; θi))2i\n,\n(2)\nwhere yi = Es′∼E [r + γ maxa′ Q(s′, a′; θi−1)|s, a] is the target for iteration i and ρ(s, a) is a\nprobability distribution over sequences s and actions a that we refer to as the behaviour distribution.\nThe parameters from the previous iteration θi−1 are held ﬁxed when optimising the loss function\nLi (θi). Note that the targets depend on the network weights; this is in contrast with the targets used\nfor supervised learning, which are ﬁxed before learning begins. Differentiating the loss function\nwith respect to the weights we arrive at the following gradient,\n∇θiLi (θi) = Es,a∼ρ(·);s′∼E\nh\u0010\nr + γ max\na′ Q(s′, a′; θi−1) −Q(s, a; θi)\n\u0011\n∇θiQ(s, a; θi)\ni\n.\n(3)\nRather than computing the full expectations in the above gradient, it is often computationally expe-\ndient to optimise the loss function by stochastic gradient descent. If the weights are updated after\nevery time-step, and the expectations are replaced by single samples from the behaviour distribution\nρ and the emulator E respectively, then we arrive at the familiar Q-learning algorithm [26].\nNote that this algorithm is model-free: it solves the reinforcement learning task directly using sam-\nples from the emulator E, without explicitly constructing an estimate of E. It is also off-policy: it\nlearns about the greedy strategy a = maxa Q(s, a; θ), while following a behaviour distribution that\nensures adequate exploration of the state space. In practice, the behaviour distribution is often se-\nlected by an ϵ-greedy strategy that follows the greedy strategy with probability 1 −ϵ and selects a\nrandom action with probability ϵ.\n3\nRelated Work\nPerhaps the best-known success story of reinforcement learning is TD-gammon, a backgammon-\nplaying program which learnt entirely by reinforcement learning and self-play, and achieved a super-\nhuman level of play [24]. TD-gammon used a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm similar\nto Q-learning, and approximated the value function using a multi-layer perceptron with one hidden\nlayer1.\nHowever, early attempts to follow up on TD-gammon, including applications of the same method to\nchess, Go and checkers were less successful. This led to a widespread belief that the TD-gammon\napproach was a special case that only worked in backgammon, perhaps because the stochasticity in\nthe dice rolls helps explore the state space and also makes the value function particularly smooth\n[19].\nFurthermore, it was shown that combining model-free reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-\nlearning with non-linear function approximators [25], or indeed with off-policy learning [1] could\ncause the Q-network to diverge. Subsequently, the majority of work in reinforcement learning fo-\ncused on linear function approximators with better convergence guarantees [25].\n1In fact TD-Gammon approximated the state value function V (s) rather than the action-value function\nQ(s, a), and learnt on-policy directly from the self-play games\n3\nMore recently, there has been a revival of interest in combining deep learning with reinforcement\nlearning. Deep neural networks have been used to estimate the environment E; restricted Boltzmann\nmachines have been used to estimate the value function [21]; or the policy [9]. In addition, the\ndivergence issues with Q-learning have been partially addressed by gradient temporal-difference\nmethods. These methods are proven to converge when evaluating a ﬁxed policy with a nonlinear\nfunction approximator [14]; or when learning a control policy with linear function approximation\nusing a restricted variant of Q-learning [15]. However, these methods have not yet been extended to\nnonlinear control.\nPerhaps the most similar prior work to our own approach is neural ﬁtted Q-learning (NFQ) [20].\nNFQ optimises the sequence of loss functions in Equation 2, using the RPROP algorithm to update\nthe parameters of the Q-network. However, it uses a batch update that has a computational cost\nper iteration that is proportional to the size of the data set, whereas we consider stochastic gradient\nupdates that have a low constant cost per iteration and scale to large data-sets. NFQ has also been\nsuccessfully applied to simple real-world control tasks using purely visual input, by ﬁrst using deep\nautoencoders to learn a low dimensional representation of the task, and then applying NFQ to this\nrepresentation [12]. In contrast our approach applies reinforcement learning end-to-end, directly\nfrom the visual inputs; as a result it may learn features that are directly relevant to discriminating\naction-values. Q-learning has also previously been combined with experience replay and a simple\nneural network [13], but again starting with a low-dimensional state rather than raw visual inputs.\nThe use of the Atari 2600 emulator as a reinforcement learning platform was introduced by [3], who\napplied standard reinforcement learning algorithms with linear function approximation and generic\nvisual features. Subsequently, results were improved by using a larger number of features, and\nusing tug-of-war hashing to randomly project the features into a lower-dimensional space [2]. The\nHyperNEAT evolutionary architecture [8] has also been applied to the Atari platform, where it was\nused to evolve (separately, for each distinct game) a neural network representing a strategy for that\ngame. When trained repeatedly against deterministic sequences using the emulator’s reset facility,\nthese strategies were able to exploit design ﬂaws in several Atari games.\n4\nDeep Reinforcement Learning\nRecent breakthroughs in computer vision and speech recognition have relied on efﬁciently training\ndeep neural networks on very large training sets. The most successful approaches are trained directly\nfrom the raw inputs, using lightweight updates based on stochastic gradient descent. By feeding\nsufﬁcient data into deep neural networks, it is often possible to learn better representations than\nhandcrafted features [11]. These successes motivate our approach to reinforcement learning. Our\ngoal is to connect a reinforcement learning algorithm to a deep neural network which operates\ndirectly on RGB images and efﬁciently process training data by using stochastic gradient updates.\nTesauro’s TD-Gammon architecture provides a starting point for such an approach. This architec-\nture updates the parameters of a network that estimates the value function, directly from on-policy\nsamples of experience, st, at, rt, st+1, at+1, drawn from the algorithm’s interactions with the envi-\nronment (or by self-play, in the case of backgammon). Since this approach was able to outperform\nthe best human backgammon players 20 years ago, it is natural to wonder whether two decades of\nhardware improvements, coupled with modern deep neural network architectures and scalable RL\nalgorithms might produce signiﬁcant progress.\nIn contrast to TD-Gammon and similar online approaches, we utilize a technique known as expe-\nrience replay [13] where we store the agent’s experiences at each time-step, et = (st, at, rt, st+1)\nin a data-set D = e1, ..., eN, pooled over many episodes into a replay memory. During the inner\nloop of the algorithm, we apply Q-learning updates, or minibatch updates, to samples of experience,\ne ∼D, drawn at random from the pool of stored samples. After performing experience replay,\nthe agent selects and executes an action according to an ϵ-greedy policy. Since using histories of\narbitrary length as inputs to a neural network can be difﬁcult, our Q-function instead works on ﬁxed\nlength representation of histories produced by a function φ. The full algorithm, which we call deep\nQ-learning, is presented in Algorithm 1.\nThis approach has several advantages over standard online Q-learning [23]. First, each step of\nexperience is potentially used in many weight updates, which allows for greater data efﬁciency.\n4\nAlgorithm 1 Deep Q-learning with Experience Replay\nInitialize replay memory D to capacity N\nInitialize action-value function Q with random weights\nfor episode = 1, M do\nInitialise sequence s1 = {x1} and preprocessed sequenced φ1 = φ(s1)\nfor t = 1, T do\nWith probability ϵ select a random action at\notherwise select at = maxa Q∗(φ(st), a; θ)\nExecute action at in emulator and observe reward rt and image xt+1\nSet st+1 = st, at, xt+1 and preprocess φt+1 = φ(st+1)\nStore transition (φt, at, rt, φt+1) in D\nSample random minibatch of transitions (φj, aj, rj, φj+1) from D\nSet yj =\n\u001a\nrj\nfor terminal φj+1\nrj + γ maxa′ Q(φj+1, a′; θ)\nfor non-terminal φj+1\nPerform a gradient descent step on (yj −Q(φj, aj; θ))2 according to equation 3\nend for\nend for\nSecond, learning directly from consecutive samples is inefﬁcient, due to the strong correlations\nbetween the samples; randomizing the samples breaks these correlations and therefore reduces the\nvariance of the updates. Third, when learning on-policy the current parameters determine the next\ndata sample that the parameters are trained on. For example, if the maximizing action is to move left\nthen the training samples will be dominated by samples from the left-hand side; if the maximizing\naction then switches to the right then the training distribution will also switch. It is easy to see how\nunwanted feedback loops may arise and the parameters could get stuck in a poor local minimum, or\neven diverge catastrophically [25]. By using experience replay the behavior distribution is averaged\nover many of its previous states, smoothing out learning and avoiding oscillations or divergence in\nthe parameters. Note that when learning by experience replay, it is necessary to learn off-policy\n(because our current parameters are different to those used to generate the sample), which motivates\nthe choice of Q-learning.\nIn practice, our algorithm only stores the last N experience tuples in the replay memory, and samples\nuniformly at random from D when performing updates. This approach is in some respects limited\nsince the memory buffer does not differentiate important transitions and always overwrites with\nrecent transitions due to the ﬁnite memory size N. Similarly, the uniform sampling gives equal\nimportance to all transitions in the replay memory. A more sophisticated sampling strategy might\nemphasize transitions from which we can learn the most, similar to prioritized sweeping [17].\n4.1\nPreprocessing and Model Architecture\nWorking directly with raw Atari frames, which are 210 × 160 pixel images with a 128 color palette,\ncan be computationally demanding, so we apply a basic preprocessing step aimed at reducing the\ninput dimensionality. The raw frames are preprocessed by ﬁrst converting their RGB representation\nto gray-scale and down-sampling it to a 110×84 image. The ﬁnal input representation is obtained by\ncropping an 84 × 84 region of the image that roughly captures the playing area. The ﬁnal cropping\nstage is only required because we use the GPU implementation of 2D convolutions from [11], which\nexpects square inputs. For the experiments in this paper, the function φ from algorithm 1 applies this\npreprocessing to the last 4 frames of a history and stacks them to produce the input to the Q-function.\nThere are several possible ways of parameterizing Q using a neural network. Since Q maps history-\naction pairs to scalar estimates of their Q-value, the history and the action have been used as inputs\nto the neural network by some previous approaches [20, 12]. The main drawback of this type\nof architecture is that a separate forward pass is required to compute the Q-value of each action,\nresulting in a cost that scales linearly with the number of actions. We instead use an architecture\nin which there is a separate output unit for each possible action, and only the state representation is\nan input to the neural network. The outputs correspond to the predicted Q-values of the individual\naction for the input state. The main advantage of this type of architecture is the ability to compute\nQ-values for all possible actions in a given state with only a single forward pass through the network.\n5\nWe now describe the exact architecture used for all seven Atari games. The input to the neural\nnetwork consists is an 84 × 84 × 4 image produced by φ. The ﬁrst hidden layer convolves 16 8 × 8\nﬁlters with stride 4 with the input image and applies a rectiﬁer nonlinearity [10, 18]. The second\nhidden layer convolves 32 4 × 4 ﬁlters with stride 2, again followed by a rectiﬁer nonlinearity. The\nﬁnal hidden layer is fully-connected and consists of 256 rectiﬁer units. The output layer is a fully-\nconnected linear layer with a single output for each valid action. The number of valid actions varied\nbetween 4 and 18 on the games we considered. We refer to convolutional networks trained with our\napproach as Deep Q-Networks (DQN).\n5\nExperiments\nSo far, we have performed experiments on seven popular ATARI games – Beam Rider, Breakout,\nEnduro, Pong, Q*bert, Seaquest, Space Invaders. We use the same network architecture, learning\nalgorithm and hyperparameters settings across all seven games, showing that our approach is robust\nenough to work on a variety of games without incorporating game-speciﬁc information. While we\nevaluated our agents on the real and unmodiﬁed games, we made one change to the reward structure\nof the games during training only. Since the scale of scores varies greatly from game to game, we\nﬁxed all positive rewards to be 1 and all negative rewards to be −1, leaving 0 rewards unchanged.\nClipping the rewards in this manner limits the scale of the error derivatives and makes it easier to\nuse the same learning rate across multiple games. At the same time, it could affect the performance\nof our agent since it cannot differentiate between rewards of different magnitude.\nIn these experiments, we used the RMSProp algorithm with minibatches of size 32. The behavior\npolicy during training was ϵ-greedy with ϵ annealed linearly from 1 to 0.1 over the ﬁrst million\nframes, and ﬁxed at 0.1 thereafter. We trained for a total of 10 million frames and used a replay\nmemory of one million most recent frames.\nFollowing previous approaches to playing Atari games, we also use a simple frame-skipping tech-\nnique [3]. More precisely, the agent sees and selects actions on every kth frame instead of every\nframe, and its last action is repeated on skipped frames. Since running the emulator forward for one\nstep requires much less computation than having the agent select an action, this technique allows\nthe agent to play roughly k times more games without signiﬁcantly increasing the runtime. We use\nk = 4 for all games except Space Invaders where we noticed that using k = 4 makes the lasers\ninvisible because of the period at which they blink. We used k = 3 to make the lasers visible and\nthis change was the only difference in hyperparameter values between any of the games.\n5.1\nTraining and Stability\nIn supervised learning, one can easily track the performance of a model during training by evaluating\nit on the training and validation sets. In reinforcement learning, however, accurately evaluating the\nprogress of an agent during training can be challenging. Since our evaluation metric, as suggested\nby [3], is the total reward the agent collects in an episode or game averaged over a number of\ngames, we periodically compute it during training. The average total reward metric tends to be very\nnoisy because small changes to the weights of a policy can lead to large changes in the distribution of\nstates the policy visits . The leftmost two plots in ﬁgure 2 show how the average total reward evolves\nduring training on the games Seaquest and Breakout. Both averaged reward plots are indeed quite\nnoisy, giving one the impression that the learning algorithm is not making steady progress. Another,\nmore stable, metric is the policy’s estimated action-value function Q, which provides an estimate of\nhow much discounted reward the agent can obtain by following its policy from any given state. We\ncollect a ﬁxed set of states by running a random policy before training starts and track the average\nof the maximum2 predicted Q for these states. The two rightmost plots in ﬁgure 2 show that average\npredicted Q increases much more smoothly than the average total reward obtained by the agent and\nplotting the same metrics on the other ﬁve games produces similarly smooth curves. In addition\nto seeing relatively smooth improvement to predicted Q during training we did not experience any\ndivergence issues in any of our experiments. This suggests that, despite lacking any theoretical\nconvergence guarantees, our method is able to train large neural networks using a reinforcement\nlearning signal and stochastic gradient descent in a stable manner.\n2The maximum for each state is taken over the possible actions.\n6\n 0\n 50\n 100\n 150\n 200\n 250\n 0\n 10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90  100\nAverage Reward per Episode\nTraining Epochs\nAverage Reward on Breakout\n 0\n 200\n 400\n 600\n 800\n 1000\n 1200\n 1400\n 1600\n 1800\n 0\n 10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90  100\nAverage Reward per Episode\nTraining Epochs\nAverage Reward on Seaquest\n 0\n 0.5\n 1\n 1.5\n 2\n 2.5\n 3\n 3.5\n 4\n 0\n 10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90  100\nAverage Action Value (Q)\nTraining Epochs\nAverage Q on Breakout\n 0\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n 0\n 10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90  100\nAverage Action Value (Q)\nTraining Epochs\nAverage Q on Seaquest\nFigure 2:\nThe two plots on the left show average reward per episode on Breakout and Seaquest\nrespectively during training.

The ﬁgure shows\nthat the predicted value jumps after an enemy appears on the left of the screen (point A). The agent\nthen ﬁres a torpedo at the enemy and the predicted value peaks as the torpedo is about to hit the\nenemy (point B). Finally, the value falls to roughly its original value after the enemy disappears\n(point C). Figure 3 demonstrates that our method is able to learn how the value function evolves for\na reasonably complex sequence of events.\n5.3\nMain Evaluation\nWe compare our results with the best performing methods from the RL literature [3, 4]. The method\nlabeled Sarsa used the Sarsa algorithm to learn linear policies on several different feature sets hand-\nengineered for the Atari task and we report the score for the best performing feature set [3]. Con-\ntingency used the same basic approach as Sarsa but augmented the feature sets with a learned\nrepresentation of the parts of the screen that are under the agent’s control [4]. Note that both of these\nmethods incorporate signiﬁcant prior knowledge about the visual problem by using background sub-\ntraction and treating each of the 128 colors as a separate channel. Since many of the Atari games use\none distinct color for each type of object, treating each color as a separate channel can be similar to\nproducing a separate binary map encoding the presence of each object type. In contrast, our agents\nonly receive the raw RGB screenshots as input and must learn to detect objects on their own.\nIn addition to the learned agents, we also report scores for an expert human game player and a policy\nthat selects actions uniformly at random. The human performance is the median reward achieved\nafter around two hours of playing each game. Note that our reported human scores are much higher\nthan the ones in Bellemare et al. [3]. For the learned methods, we follow the evaluation strategy used\nin Bellemare et al. [3, 5] and report the average score obtained by running an ϵ-greedy policy with\nϵ = 0.05 for a ﬁxed number of steps. The ﬁrst ﬁve rows of table 1 show the per-game average scores\non all games. Our approach (labeled DQN) outperforms the other learning methods by a substantial\nmargin on all seven games despite incorporating almost no prior knowledge about the inputs.\nWe also include a comparison to the evolutionary policy search approach from [8] in the last three\nrows of table 1. We report two sets of results for this method. The HNeat Best score reﬂects the\nresults obtained by using a hand-engineered object detector algorithm that outputs the locations and\n7\nB.

The HNeat Pixel score is obtained by using the special 8 color\nchannel representation of the Atari emulator that represents an object label map at each channel.\nThis method relies heavily on ﬁnding a deterministic sequence of states that represents a successful\nexploit. It is unlikely that strategies learnt in this way will generalize to random perturbations;\ntherefore the algorithm was only evaluated on the highest scoring single episode. In contrast, our\nalgorithm is evaluated on ϵ-greedy control sequences, and must therefore generalize across a wide\nvariety of possible situations. Nevertheless, we show that on all the games, except Space Invaders,\nnot only our max evaluation results (row 8), but also our average results (row 4) achieve better\nperformance.\nFinally, we show that our method achieves better performance than an expert human player on\nBreakout, Enduro and Pong and it achieves close to human performance on Beam Rider. The games\nQ*bert, Seaquest, Space Invaders, on which we are far from human performance, are more chal-\nlenging because they require the network to ﬁnd a strategy that extends over long time scales.\n6\nConclusion\nThis paper introduced a new deep learning model for reinforcement learning, and demonstrated its\nability to master difﬁcult control policies for Atari 2600 computer games, using only raw pixels\nas input. We also presented a variant of online Q-learning that combines stochastic minibatch up-\ndates with experience replay memory to ease the training of deep networks for RL. Our approach\ngave state-of-the-art results in six of the seven games it was tested on, with no adjustment of the\narchitecture or hyperparameters.\nReferences\n[1] Leemon Baird.
