INTRODUCTION\nT\nHE aging population has recently gained an increasing\nattention due to its socio-economic impact. By 2050,\nthe number of people in the European Union aged 65 and\nabove is expected to grow by 70% and the number of\npeople aged over 80 by 170%1. This demographic change\nposes increasing challenges for healthcare services and their\nadaptation to the needs of this aging population. Facing this\nproblem or reducing its effect would have a great societal\nimpact by improving the quality of life and regaining people\nindependence to make them active in society. The aim is\ntherefore to facilitate the daily activity lives of elderly or\ndependent people at home, to increase their autonomy and to\nimprove their safety. In fact, most elderly prefer to stay at\nhome in the so-called “aging in place” [2]. The emergence of\nnovel adapted technologies such as wearable and ubiquitous\ntechnologies is becoming a privileged solution to provide\nD. Trabelsi, S. Mohammed and Y.

A large amount of\nwork has been done in this active topic over the past decades;\nnevertheless it is still an open and challenging problem [4].\nSeveral techniques have been used to quantify these activities\nsuch as video-based sensors [5], wearable-based sensors,\nenvironmental sensors and object sensors (smart phones,\nRFID, etc.). Recently, the use of wearable-sensors based\nsystems for activity recognition has gained more attention on\na large number of technological ﬁelds such as navigation,\nmonitoring and control of aircrafts [6], [7], medical application\n[8], [9], localization and robots [10], [11]. Among the inertial\nsensors used for activity recognition, the accelerometers\nare the most commonly used [12]. They have shown\nsatisfactory results to measure the human activities in both\nlaboratory/clinical and free-living environment settings [13].\nIn addition, the latest advances in Micro-ElectroMechanical\nSystems (MEMS) technology have greatly promoted the use\nof accelerometers thanks to the considerable reduction in\nsize, cost and energy consumption. Early studies in activity\nrecognition used uniaxial accelerometers, while recent studies\nuse mainly tri-axial accelerometers [14], [15].\nII. RELATED WORK ON HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION\nRegarding the human activity classiﬁcation, one can make\nthe distinction between supervised and unsupervised classiﬁ-\ncation approaches. Supervised classiﬁcation techniques consist\nin inferring a decision rule from labelled training data. The\nuse of the supervised activity classiﬁcation approaches has\nshown promising results [16]. Some supervised approaches\nhave enhanced the activity recognition process performances\nby using spatio-temporal information [17]. Regarding the\nalgorithms used in the supervised context, one can cite k-\nNearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm [18], multi-class Support\nVector Machines (SVM) [19] and Artiﬁcial Neural Networks\n(ANN) including both MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) [20], [21]\nand Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks [22].\nNevertheless, the collection of sufﬁcient amounts of labelled\ndata for a various and rich set of free-living activities may be\nsometimes difﬁcult to achieve and computationally expensive\n[23]. On the other hand, unsupervised classiﬁcation techniques\ntry to directly construct models from unlabelled data either\n2\nby estimating the properties of their underlying probability\ndensity (called density estimation) or by discovering groups\nof similar examples (called clustering). The unsupervised\nlearning techniques are of particular interest for an exploratory\nanalysis of large amounts of unlabelled data. They can also\nconsist in a preliminary task to further run a supervised\nclassiﬁer based on the obtained partition of the data. The use\nof an unsupervised approach may be needed in such a context\nof activity recognition when it is difﬁcult to have labels for\nthe data.\nRegarding the approaches used in the unsupervised context,\none can cite the well-known k-Means algorithm [24], the\nGaussian Mixture Models (GMM) approach [25] and the one\nbased on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [26], [27] or HMM\nwith GMM emission probabilities [28]. Both the GMM and\nthe HMM approaches use the EM algorithm [29].\nThe HMM has shown good results in earlier exploratory\nstudies thanks to their main advantage of suitability to model\nsequential data which is the case of monitoring human\nactivities. Indeed, the acceleration data are measured over\ntime during physical human activities of a person and are\ntherefore sequential over time. The EM algorithm [29]\n(also called Baum-Welch [1]) in the context of HMM is\nparticularity adapted for unsupervised learning.\nIn this study, an unsupervised approach for human activity\nrecognition is proposed. It combines an HMM-based model\nwith the use of acceleration data acquired during sequences\nof different human activities. More speciﬁcally, the proposed\napproach is based on a Hidden Markov Model in a multiple\nregression context and will be denoted by MHMMR.\nAs the sequences of acceleration data consist in multidimen-\nsional time series where each dimension is an acceleration, the\nactivity recognition problem is therefore formulated through\nthe proposed MHMMR model as the one of joint segmentation\nof multidimensional time series, each segment is associated\nwith an activity. In the proposed model, each activity is\nrepresented by a regression model and the switching from one\nactivity to another is governed by a hidden Markov chain.\nThe MHMMR parameters are learned in an unsupervised way\nfrom unlabelled raw acceleration data acquired during human\nactivities.\nThe most likely sequence of activities is then estimated\nusing the Viterbi algorithm [30]. The proposed technique is\nthen evaluated on real-world acceleration data collected from\nthree sensors placed at the chest, the right thigh and the left\nankle of the subject.\nThis study is an extension of the paper [31] where additional\ntechnical implementations are shown: Twelve activities and\ntransitions are studied and performances of the proposed\napproach are evaluated and compared to those of some well\nknown unsupervised and supervised techniques for activity\nrecognition.\nThis paper is organized as follows; section III presents the\nexperimental protocol and the data acquisition platform. Sec-\ntion IV presents the proposed model and its unsupervised\nparameter estimation technique from unlabelled acceleration\ndata. In section V, the performances of the proposed approach\nare evaluated and compared to those of some well known un-\nsupervised and supervised techniques for activity recognition.\nIII. DATA COLLECTION\nIn this study, human activities are classiﬁed using three\nsensors placed at the chest, the right thigh and the left ankle\nrespectively as shown in Figure 1. Sensors placement is\nchosen to represent predominantly upper-body activities such\nas standing up, sitting down, etc. and predominantly lower\nbody activities such as walking, stair ascent, stair descent,\netc. The sensor’s placement guarantees at the same time less\nconstraint and better comfort for the wearer. The attachment\nof the sensors to the human body should be well ﬁtted and\nsecured (Fig. 1). These sensors consist of three MTx 3-DOF\ninertial trackers developed by Xsens Technologies [32]. Each\nMTx unit consists of a tri-axial accelerometer measuring the\nacceleration in the 3-D space (with a dynamic range of ±5g\nwhere g represents the gravitational constant). Our experiences\nshow also that the measured ankle-sensor accelerations during\nthe different activities do not exceed the limit of ±5g. The\nsampling frequency is set to 25 Hz, which is sufﬁcient and\nlarger than 20 Hz the required frequency to assess daily\nphysical activity [33]. The sensors were ﬁxed on the subject\nwith the help of an assistant before the beginning of the\nmeasurement operation. Raw acceleration data are therefore\ncollected over time when performing the activities. The MTx\nunits are connected to a central unit called Xbus Master that is\nattached to the subject’s belt. Figure 2 shows the data gathering\nprocess from the Xbus-MTx acquisition system to the host pc.\nThe Xbus Master is directly connected to the chest MTx unit\nwhile the remainig MTx units (thigh and ankle) are connected\nin series. Data transmission between the Xbus Master and the\npc is carried out through a Bluetooth wireless link.\nFig. 1.\nMTx-Xbus inertial tracker and sensors placement\nFig. 2.\nData ghathering from the MTx-Xbus acquisition system\nThe\nexperiments\nwere\nperformed\nat\nthe\nLISSI\nLab/University of Paris-Est Cr´eteil (UPEC) by six different\n3\nhealthy subjects of different ages (who are not the researchers)\nin the ofﬁce environment. In order to gather various and rich\ndataset, the recruited volunteer subjects have been chosen\nin a given margin of age (25-30) and weight (55-70) kg.\nTwelve activities and transitions were studied and are listed\nas follows: Stairs down (A1) - Standing (A2) - Sitting down\n(A3) - Sitting (A4) - From sitting to sitting on the ground\n(A5) - Sitting on the ground (A6) - Lying down (A7) - Lying\n(A8) - From lying to sitting on the ground (A9) - Standing up\n(A10) - Walking (A11) - Stairs up (A12). The activities were\nchosen to have an appropriate representation of everyday\nactivities involving different parts of the body (ﬁg. 3). The\nrecognized activities and transition differ in duration and\nintensity level. Note that the activities A3, A5, A7, A9 and\nA10 represent dynamic transitions between static activities.\nEach subject was asked to perform the twelve activities in his\nown style and was not restricted on how the activities should\nbe performed but only with the sequential activities order. In\naddition, the duration of each activity is not restricted to be\nthe same as it may vary from one subject to another.\nFig. 3.\nExamples of some considered activities: a) Climbing Stairs Down,\nb) Climbing Stairs Up, c) Walking, d) Sitting, e) Standing Up, f) Sitting on\nthe ground.\nWith three MTx sensor units, each one with a tri-axial\naccelerometer, a total of nine accelerations are therefore\nmeasured and recorded overtime for each activity. Since the\ngoal is to recognize human activities from only the raw\nacceleration data, the acquired acceleration signals can be\nseen as multidimensional time series (of dimension 9) with\nregime changes due to the changes of activities over time. The\nactivity recognition problem can therefore be formulated as a\nproblem of multidimensional time series segmentation. Indeed,\nsegmenting the time series according to different unknown\nregimes over time is equivalent to classifying the acceleration\ndata into one set of activities; each activity being associated\nwith a regime. This will be detailed in the next section that is\ndedicated to the proposed Hidden Markov Model Regression\n(HMMR) approach.\nIV. SEGMENTATION WITH MULTIPLE HIDDEN MARKOV\nMODEL REGRESSION - MHMMR\nIn this section, the problem of activity recognition (clas-\nsiﬁcation) is formulated as the one of joint segmentation of\nmultidimensional time series. Indeed, the acceleration data are\npresented as multidimensional time series presenting various\nregime changes. In such context, the goal is to provide an au-\ntomatic partition of the data into different segments (regimes),\neach segment being considered afterwards as an activity.\nVarious modelling approaches of time series presenting\nregime changes have been proposed in literature. One can\ncite in particular the piecewise regression as one of the most\nadapted modelling approaches [34], [35]. The piecewise model\nhas been applied in many domains including ﬁnance, engineer-\ning, economics, and bioinformatics [36]. In the piecewise re-\ngression model [35], data are partitioned into several segments,\neach segment being characterized by its mean polynomial\ncurve and its variance. However, the parameter estimation\nin such method requires the use of dynamic programming\nalgorithm [37], [38] which may be computationally expensive\nespecially for time series with large number of observations.\nMoreover, the standard piecewise regression model usually\nassumes that noise variance is uniform for all the segments\n(homoskedastic model). An alternative approach extended in\nthis paper is based on Hidden Markov Model Regression [39].\nThis approach can be seen as an extension of the standard\nHidden Markov Model (HMM) [27] to regression analysis.\nEach regime is described by a regression model rather than a\nsimple constant mean over time, while preserving the Markov\nprocess modelling for the sequence of unknown (hidden)\nactivities. Indeed, standard HMM-based approaches use simple\nGaussian densities as density of observation. However, in the\nHMM regression context, each observation is assumed to be\na noisy polynomial function to better model very structured\ndata as the acceleration data. The approach we propose further\nextends the HMM model to a multiple regression setting. This\nis due to the fact the observed acceleration data is multidi-\nmensional. In the following, the Hidden Markov Regression\nModel for time series modelling is used by formulating its\nbasic and multiple regression setting. In this framework, each\nobservation, denoted by yi, represents the ith acceleration\nmeasurement while the associated state (class), denoted by\nzi, represents its corresponding activity.\nA. General description of the Multiple Hidden Markov Model\nRegression\nIn Hidden Markov Model Regression (HMMR), each time\nseries is represented as a sequence of observed univariate\nvariables (y1, y2, . . . , yn), where the observation yi at time ti\nis assumed to be generated by the following regression model\n[39]:\nyi = βT\nziti + σziǫi\n;\nǫi ∼N(0, 1),\n(i = 1, . . . , n) (1)\nwhere zi ∈{1, . . ., K} is a hidden discrete-valued variable. In\nthis application case, zi represents the hidden class label (ac-\ntivity) of each acceleration data point and K corresponds to the\nnumber of considered activities. The variable zi controls the\nswitching from one polynomial regression model associated\nto one activity, to another of K models at time ti. The vector\nβzi = (βzi0, . . . , βzip)T is the one of regression coefﬁcients\nof the p-order polynomial regression model zi and σzi is\nits corresponding standard deviation, ti = (1, ti, t2\ni . . . , tp\ni )T\nis the p + 1 dimensional covariate vector at time ti and\nthe ǫi’s are standard Gaussian variables representing an ad-\nditive noise. The HMMR assumes that the hidden sequence\nz = (z1, . . . , zn) is a homogeneous Markov chain of ﬁrst\n4\norder parameterized by the initial state distribution π and the\ntransition matrix A. It can be shown that, conditionally on a\nregression model k (zi = k), yi has a Gaussian distribution\nwith mean βT\nk ti and variance σ2\nk. Regarding the multiple\nregression case, the model can be formulated as follows:\ny(1)\ni\n=\nβ(1)T\nzi\nti + σ(1)\nzi ǫi\ny(2)\ni\n=\nβ(2)T\nzi\nti + σ(2)\nzi ǫi\n...\n...\ny(d)\ni\n=\nβ(d)T\nzi\nti + σ(d)\nzi ǫi\n(2)\nwhere d represents the dimension of the time series (sequence)\nand the latent process z simultaneously governs all the univari-\nate time series components. The model (2) can be rewritten in\na matrix form as follows:\nyi = BT\nziti + ei\n;\nei ∼N(0, Σzi),\n(i = 1, . . . , n) (3)\nwhere yi = (y(1)\ni\n, . . . , y(d)\ni\n)T is the ith observation of the\ntime series in Rd, Bk =\nh\nβ(1)\nk , . . . , β(d)\nk\ni\nis a (p + 1) × d\ndimensional matrix of the multiple regression model param-\neters associated with the regime (class) zi = k and Σzi its\ncorresponding covariance matrix.\nThe\nMultiple\nHMMR\nmodel\nis\ntherefore\nfully\nparameterized\nby\nthe\nparameter\nvector\nθ\n=\n(π, A, B1, . . . , BK, Σ1, . . . , ΣK).\nThe\nnext\nsub-section\ngives the parameter estimation technique by maximizing\nthe\nobserved\ndata\nlikelihood\nthrough\nthe\nExpectation-\nMaximization (EM) algorithm. The parameter vector θ is\nestimated using the well-known maximum likelihood method\nthanks to its very well-known attractive limiting properties\nof consistency, asymptotic normality and efﬁciency. Indeed,\nin our experiments, a considerable number of data points is\nacquired during time, which makes the sample size suitable\nto take advantage of the limiting properties of the maximum\nlikelihood estimator. The log-likelihood to be maximized in\nthis case is written as follows:\nL(θ) = log p(y1, . . . , yn; θ)\n= log\nX\nz\np(z1; π)\nn\nY\ni=2\np(zi|zi−1; A)\nn\nY\ni=1\nN(yi; BT\nziti, Σzi) (4)\nSince this log-likelihood cannot be maximized directly, this\ncan be performed using the EM algorithm [29], [40], that is\nknown as the Baum-Welch algorithm in the HMM context\n[1], [27]. This algorithm alternates between the two following\nsteps:\na) E-step: This step computes the conditional expecta-\ntion of the complete-data log-likelihood given the observed\ndata Y, time t and a current parameter estimation denoted by\nθ(q):\nQ(θ, θ(q)) = E\nh\nlog p(Y, z|t; θ)|Y, t; θ(q)i\n·\n(5)\nIt can be easily shown that this step only requires the calcu-\nlation of:\n• the posterior probability\nτ (q)\nik = p(zi = k|Y, t; θ(q))\n(6)\n∀i = 1, . . . , n and k = 1, . . . , K which is the posterior\nprobability that yi originates from the kth polynomial\nregression model given the whole observation sequence\nand the current parameter estimation θ(q),\n• and the joint posterior probability of the state k at time i\nand the state ℓat time i −1 given the whole observation\nsequence and the current parameter estimation θ(q), that\nis\nξ(q)\niℓk=p(zi = k, zi−1 = ℓ|Y, t; θ(q))\n(7)\n∀i = 2, . . . , n and k, ℓ= 1, . . . , K.\nThese posterior probabilities are computed by the forward-\nbackward procedures in the same way as for a standard HMM\n[27]. More calculation details on this step can be found in [27].\nb) M-step: In this step, the value of the parameter θ is\nupdated by computing the parameter θ(q+1) that maximizes\nthe conditional expectation (5) with respect to θ. It can be\nshown that this maximization leads to the following updating\nrules. The updates of the parameters governing the hidden\nMarkov chain z are the ones of a standard HMM and are\ngiven by:\nπ(q+1)\nk\n= τ(q)\n1k\n(8)\nA(q+1)\nℓk\n=\nPn\ni=2 ξ(q)\nikℓ\nPn\ni=2 τ (q)\nik\n(9)\nUpdating the regression parameter consists in performing\nK weighted multiple polynomial regressions. The regression\nparameter matrices updates are given by :\nB(q+1)\nk\n=\nh\nn\nX\ni=1\nτ (q)\nik titT\ni\ni−1\nn\nX\ni=1\nτ (q)\nik tiyT\ni\n=\n(XT W(q)\nk X)−1XT W(q)\nk Y,\n(10)\nwhere W(q)\nk\nis a n × n diagonal matrix of weights whose di-\nagonal elements are the posterior probabilities (τ (q)\n1k , . . . , τ (q)\nnk )\nand X is the n × (p + 1) regression matrix given by\n(t1, . . . , tn)T .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nThis section presents experiments carried out to validate\nthe two main ideas explored throughout this paper, i.e., the\nsegmentation and the classiﬁcation of the human activity\nfrom raw acceleration data using a MHMMR approach within\nan unsupervised learning framework2. Series of experiments\nwere conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed\napproach and also to perform comparisons with well-known\nunsupervised and supervised classiﬁcation approaches.\n2Note that, in this study, the raw acceleration data are directly used without\nany feature extraction. Indeed, in many area of application a feature extraction\nstep is needed before running the classiﬁer and may itself lead to an additional\ncomputational cost, which can be penalizing in real time applications.\n5\nA. Performance evaluation\nGiven a set of 9-dimensional acceleration data from three\ntriaxial accelerometer modules mounted on the chest, right\nthigh and left ankle, the proposed approach allows both\nsegmentation and classiﬁcation of the twelve activities. Each\nobtained segment is indeed considered as an activity, achieving\nthus a classiﬁcation task. We chose to take as a ground truth\nabout the class of an activity, labeling obtained thanks to\nan expert. While the different subjects were performing the\nsequence of activities, an independent operator was asked\nto annotate the activities, thus providing a labeling of the\ndataset3. The provided partition is indeed matched to the\ntrue labels (ground truth) by evaluating all the possible label\nswitchings. The label switching leading to the minimum error\nrate is selected as the best class prediction. For the supervised\nclassiﬁcation approaches, data labels were used to both train\nand test the models. In this case, the performance was esti-\nmated through a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. Regarding\nthe classiﬁcation problem, confusion matrices between the\nannotated classes and the estimated classes for all the subjects\nin the database are computed. The criteria used to evaluate the\nperformance of an approach are the correct classiﬁcation rate\nand the prediction accuracy in terms of precision and recall.\nIn the following, the results of the MHMMR approach\nobtained on real acceleration data of human activities are\nﬁrst detailed, then they are compared to those of standard\nunsupervised and supervised classiﬁcation approaches.\nB. Classiﬁcation performance of the MHMMR\nThe following experiments were conducted to qualitatively\nassess the performances of the proposed approach in terms\nof automatic segmentation of human activity on the basis of\nraw acceleration signals. From the sequence of nine observed\nvariables yi = (y(1)\ni\n, . . . , y(9)\ni\n) at each time step i for i =\n1, . . . , n corresponding to the 3-axis accelerations measured\nby the three sensors, the MHMMR is used to identify the\nlatent sequence z = (z1, . . . , zn) corresponding to the twelve\nactivities. The number of classes K is ﬁxed to twelve and the\norder of regression p is ﬁxed empirically to three as it gives the\nbest performance among several values of p. Model parameters\nare estimated from the data using the algorithm detailed in\nSection IV-A. Figures 4 and 5 show the performance of the\nproposed method to segment the two following sequences:\n• Sequence 1: Standing - Sitting down - Sitting - From\nsitting to sitting on the ground - Sitting on the ground -\nLying down - Lying,\n• Sequence 2: Standing - Walking - Climbing up stairs -\nStanding.\nThese ﬁgures represent the evolution of the acceleration data\nand the corresponding posterior probabilities for the two\ndifferent sequences. Note that the posterior probability is\nthe probability that a sample i will be generated by the\nregression model k given the whole sequence of observations\n(y1, . . . , yn). It can be observed that the obtained sequences\n3Note that the labels were not used to train unsupervised models; they were\nonly used afterwards for the evaluation of classiﬁcation errors.\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n1\n0\nk = 1\nk = 2\nk = 3\nk = 4\nk = 7\nk = 6\nk = 5\nTime (s)\nAcceleration (m/s2)\nProbability\nTrue Labels\nA2\nA3\nA4\nA5\nA6\nA7\nA8\nFig. 4.

Table IV shows also that the k-NN (k = 1) has the\nbest classiﬁcation algorithm in terms of prediction accuracy\nsince it achieves 95.9% of precision and recall. Compared\nto standard supervised classiﬁcation techniques (using class\nlabels), these results are very encouraging since the proposed\napproach performs in an unsupervised way. The main errors\nare due to the confusions located in transition segments.\nThis is due to the fact that the transitions lengths are much\nshorter than the activities ones. Since the confusion matrix\nwas computed using real labels supplied by a human expert,\nthe obtained labels may not correspond perfectly to the expert\nlabels, particularly, during transitions. Indeed, it is difﬁcult to\nhave the ground truth of the limit between an activity and a\ntransition. Furthermore, the aforecited supervised classiﬁcation\napproaches require a labelled collection of data to be trained.\nBesides, they do not explicit the temporal dependence in their\nmodel formulation as they assume an independent hypothesis\nfor the data; the data are treated as several realizations in\nthe multidimensional space (Rd) without considering pos-\nsible dependencies between the activities. Moreover, it can\nbe noticed that assigning a new sample to a class using\nthe k-NN approach requires the computation of as many\ndistances as there are examples in the dataset, which may\nlead to a signiﬁcant computation time. Using the proposed\napproach, classiﬁcation needs the computation of the posterior\nprobabilities, as many as there are activities. On the other hand,\ncomparison with the unsupervised classiﬁcation approaches\n(k-Means and the GMM) and the standard HMM shows that\nthe proposed method gives relatively a high rate and better\nperformances.\nVI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS\nIn this paper, we presented a statistical approach based on\nhidden Markov models in a regression context for the joint\nsegmentation of multivariate time series of human activities.\nIt is based upon the use of raw accelerometer data acquired\nfrom body mounted inertial sensors in a health-monitoring\ncontext. The main advantage of the proposed approach comes\nfrom the fact that the statistical model explains the regime\nchanges over time through the hidden Markov chain, each\nregime being interpreted as an activity (a class). Furthermore,\nlearning with this statistical model is performed in an un-\nsupervised way using unlabelled examples only; parameter\nestimates are computed by maximizing a likelihood criterion,\nusing a dedicated EM algorithm. Considering human activity\nrecognition within an unsupervised learning framework can\nbe particularly interesting within an exploratory data-mining\ncontext in order to automatically cluster a large amount of\nunlabelled acceleration data into different groups of activity.\nThe comparison with well-known supervised classiﬁcation\napproaches shows that the proposed method is competitive\neven when performed in an unsupervised way. This work\ncan be extended in several directions, namely integrating the\nmodel into a Bayesian context to better control the model\ncomplexity via choosing suitable prior distributions on the\nmodels parameters. Then, and perhaps more interestingly,\n7\nanother step to explore is to built a fully non Bayesian non-\nparametric model which will be useful for any kind of complex\nactivities and in which the number of activities will not have\nto be ﬁxed. In terms of application, a promising perspective in\na rehabilitation context would be to use the proposed approach\nfor recognizing in an unsupervised framework the undesirable\ncompensatory physical behaviours observed with stroke and\ninjury patients.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Baum, L.E. and Petrie, T. and Soules, G. and Weiss, N., ”A maximization\ntechnique occurring in the statistical analysis of probabilistic functions”,\nAnnals of Mathematical Statistics, vol. 41, pp 164-171, 1970.\n[2] Kaluza, B., Mirchevska, V., Dovgan, E., Lustrek, M., Gams M., ”An\nAgent-based Approach to Care in Independent Living”, In Lecture\nNotes in Computer Science, International Joint Conference on Ambient\nIntelligence (AmI-2010), Malaga, Spain, 6439, 177–186, 2010.\n[3] Lu, C.-H. and Fu L-C., ”Robust Location-Aware Activity Recognition\nUsing Wireless Sensor Network in an Attentive Home”, IEEE Transac-\ntions on Automation Science and Engineering, Vol.6, No.4, pp.598-609,\n2009.\n[4] Jinhui, Hu., and Nikolaos, V.B, ”Fast human activity recognition based on\nstructure and motion”, Pattern Recognition Letters, 32(14), 1814–1821,\n2011.\n[5] Brdiczka O., Langet M., Maisonnasse J., Crowley J.
