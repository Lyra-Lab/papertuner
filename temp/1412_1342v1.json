The ﬁnding that written texts modeled as graphs share several properties of other completely diﬀerent real\nsystems has inspired the study of language as a complex system [2]. Actually, language can be represented as a\ncomplex network in its several levels of complexity. As a consequence, morphological, syntactical and semantical\nproperties have been employed in the construction of linguistic networks [3]. Even the character level has been useful\nto unfold particular patterns [4, 5]. In the review by Cong and Liu [6], the authors emphasize the need to use the\ntopological information of complex networks modeling the various spheres of the language to better understand its\norigins, evolution and organization. In addition, the authors cite the use of networks in applications aiming at holistic\ntypology and stylistic variations. In this context, I will discuss some possible directions that could be followed in\nfuture research directed towards the understanding of language via topological characterization of complex linguistic\nnetworks. In addition, I will comment the use of network models for language processing applications. Additional\nprospects for future practical research lines will also be discussed in this comment.\nThe topological analysis of complex textual networks has been widely studied in the recent years. As for co-\noccurrence networks of characters, it was possible to verify that they follow the scale-free and small-world features [4].\nCo-occurrence networks of words (or adjacency networks) have accounted for most of the models tackling textual\napplications. In special, they have been more prevalent than syntactical networks because they represent a simpliﬁed\nrepresentation of the complex syntactical analysis [7, 8], as most of the syntactical links occur between neighboring\nwords. Despite its outward simplicity, co-occurrence networks have proven useful in many applications, such as\nin authorship recognition [9], extractive summarization [10, 11, 12], stylistic identiﬁcation [13] and part-of-speech\ntagging [14]. Furthermore, such representation has also been useful in the analysis of the complexity [15] and quality\nof texts [16]. Unfortunately, a major problem arising from the analyses performed with co-occurrence networks is\nthe diﬃculty to provide a rigorous interpretation of the factors accounting for the success of the model. Therefore,\nfuture investigations should pursue a better interpretation at the network level aiming at the understanding of the\nfundamental properties of the language. Most importantly, it is clear from some recent studies [8, 9] that novel\ntopological measurements should be introduced to capture a wider range of linguistic features.\nMany of the applications relying on network analysis outperform other traditional shallow strategies in natural lan-\nguage processing (see e.g. the extractive summarization task [10, 11]). However, when deep analyzes are performed,\nnetwork-based strategies usually do not perform better than other techniques making extensive use of semantic re-\nsources and tools. In order to improve the performance of network-based applications, I suggest a twofold research\nline: (i) the introduction of measurements consistent with the nature of the problem; and (ii) the combination of\ntopological strategies with other traditional natural language processing methods. More speciﬁcally, in (i), I propose\n1E-mail:diego.raphael@gmail.com, diego@icmc.usp.br\nPreprint submitted to Physics of Life Reviews\nJune 11, 2018\nthe conception of measurements that are able to capture semantic aspects, since the topological measurements of\nco-occurrence networks capture mostly syntactic factors [8]. Although such networks have proved useful in some\nsemantical-dependent tasks (see e.g. a topological approach to word sense disambiguation in [17]), I believe that the\ncreation of novel semantic-based measurements would improve the state of the art. Alternative forms to create the\nnetwork could also be useful to grasp semantical features hidden in the topological space. In (ii), I suggest, for exam-\nple, the introduction of a hybrid classiﬁer that could consider both linguistic (deeper linguistic processing [18]) and\ntopological attributes at the same time in a hybrid way. Examples of combinations of distinct strategies are described\nin [9], [19] and [20].\nIn sum, the network framework has proven applicable to understand the properties of the language and its ap-\nplications, especially those related to the textual classiﬁcation in several levels. Despite the limitations imposed by\nthe restrict understanding of the mechanisms behind the classiﬁcation, it is worth noting that the such representation\nremains entirely generic, being therefore useful to many tasks as well as for analyzing the evolution of languages, cul-\ntures and emotional trends. For this reason, I believe that the use of complex networks in both practical and theoretical\ninvestigations shall yield novels insights into the mechanisms behind the language.\nAcknowledgements\nI acknowledge the ﬁnancial support from S˜ao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP grant number 13/06717-4).\nReferences\n[1] Costa LdF, Oliveira Jr. ON, Travieso G, Rodrigues FA, Villas Boas PR, Antiqueira L, Viana MP, Correa Rocha, LE.
