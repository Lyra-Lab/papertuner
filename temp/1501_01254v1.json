INTRODUCTION \nPart of speech tagging is one of the pivotal steps in the \nknowledge acquiring process in natural language processing \ntask. The fundamental processing step in tagging consists of \nassigning POS tags to every token in the text with a \ncorresponding POS tag like noun, verb, preposition, etc., \nbased both on its definition, as well as its context. \nAppearance of an unknown is the one of the problems that is \nfacing in natural language parsing systems, i.e., the words \nthat appear in sentences, but are not contained within the \nlexicon. New words are continually coined to the language, \nand people will often use words is parsing, that the system \nmay not expect. This problem get worse when NLP systems \nare used for more and more on-line computer applications.  \nThis paper will discuss how well a distinction of Sinhala \nword classes, syntactic rules can be used in parsing sentences \ncontaining unknown words in natural language processing \ntasks. The distinction between closed class and open class \nwords should help to refine the possibilities for unknown \nwords, then syntactic knowledge can be used to aid in the \nanalysis of unknown words sentence structure, which can be \na strong evidence for the possible part of speech of an \nunknown word. We expect that these two knowledge sources \nwill greatly improve tagging ability to process and handle \nwith words that are not in the system corpus. \nIn this paper, we presents importance of handling \nunknown word in part of speech tagging process, and an \napproach is suggested. Section II of this paper gives an idea \nof the background of the problem and details of previous \nresearch.  Section III describes distinction of open class and \nclosed class words in Sinhala language, and section IV gives \ndetails of morphological and syntactical analysis of the \ncurrent text corpus. Section V discusses about the approach \nthat we have proposed for guessing parts of speech for \nunknown words.  Section VI and VII discuss the Evaluation, \ntesting and the results, and section VIII concludes the paper \nand describes the future work. \nII. BACKGROUND OF THE PROBLEM  OF UNKNOWN WORDS \nAppearance of unknown words is one of the frequently \noccurring problems facing in part of speech tagging process, \ni.e., the words that appear in sentences, but are not contained \nwithin the training corpus. New words are continually \nentering the language, Acronyms and proper names are \ncreated very often and new nouns and verbs are adding to the \nlanguage in a surprising rate. So it is impossible to train the \ntagger for every possible word in the language. So unknown \nwords are non-negligible in POS tagging. Therefore, in order \nto build a complete tagger, tagger must be incurred with some \nknowledge of suggesting the tag for an unknown word.  \nThere are two approaches to handle unknown words. The \nfirst approach is to attempt to construct a complete lexicon, \nthen deal with unknown words in a simple way. For example, \nrejecting the input. The second approach is to attempt to \nanalyse the word at the time of encounter with using a set of \nhuman defined rules. This would allow the tagger to process \nsentences containing unknown words.  \nBefore examining the problem in detail, it is useful to \nconsider work that has already been done by other \nresearchers. There have been several attempts to study the \nproblem of learning unknown words. These attempts have \nfollowed several different methodologies and have focused \non various aspects of the unknown words. \nPrevious techniques reported for other languages such as \nEnglish, have mostly utilize the guessing rules to analyse the \nword features by looking at leading and trailing characters. \nMost of them employ the analysis of trailing characters and \nother features such as capitalization and hyphenation. Some \nof them use more morphologically oriented word features \nsuch as suffixes, prefixes, and character lengths. The \nguessing rules are usually use knowledge of morphology of \nthe language.  \n \n \n2 \n \nThe simple possible way that suggested [2] is to consider \neach unknown word that is ambiguous among all possible \ntags, with equal probability, and then using contextual POS-\ntrigram from the corpus to suggest the proper tag.  \nThere are more complex methods, which have been tried \nout by other researchers for dealing with unknown words \nusing morphological and syntactical features of the language. \nEric Brill [3] make use of morphology to handle unknown \nwords during part of speech tagging process. Brill's tagger \nbegins by tagging unknown words as proper noun if \ncapitalized, as common noun if not. Then the tagger learns \nvarious transformational rules in the training process from the \ntagged corpus. Then it applies these rules to unknown words, \nto tag with the appropriate parts of speech category. Scott M. \nThede and Mary Harper [5] in their paper presented an \napproach using morphology and syntactic parsing rules in \npost-mortem method for determining the probable lexical \nclasses of words. Tetsuji, Taku Kudoh and Yuji [6] proposed \na POS tagging approach for unknown English words using \nSupport Vector Machines (SVM). SVM classifiers are \ncreated for each POS tag using all words in the training set, \nthen POS tags to unknown words predict using those \nclassifiers. \nBut an agglutinative language presents more serious \nproblems with unknown words, unlike English. Gary, \nJeongwon, Jong-Hyeok [4] have proposed a syllable-pattern-\nbased generalized unknown-morpheme estimation method \nusing a morpheme pattern dictionary in their statistical and \nrule-based hybrid POS tagging system for Korean language. \nSince Sinhala is also a complex, morphologically rich and \nagglutinative language, information about morphology or \nhow word is spelled is very difficult to use in unknown word \nprediction algorithms.  \nIII. OPEN CLASS VS CLOSED CLASS WORDS \nTraditionally, the definition of POS is based on \nmorphological and syntactic functions. Similar to most of \nother languages, POS in Sinhala language also can be divided \ninto two broad categories: closed class type and open class \ntype. Closed classes are those that have relatively fixed \nmembership. Closed class words are generally function \nwords: which tend to be very short, occur frequently, and \nplay an important role in grammar.  By contrast, open class is \nthe type that lager number of words are belong in any \nlanguage, and new words are continually coined or borrowed \nfrom other languages. The words that are usually containing \nmain content of a sentence are belonged to open word class \ncategory. \nIn Sinhala, all Nouns and Verbs can be categorized under \nopen word class. But Nipatha and Upasarga behave \ndifferently in Sinhala grammar. Words belong to Nipatha and \nUpasarga are not changed according to time and gender, \nUpasarga always join with nouns and provide additional \n(improved) meaning to the noun, therefore, Upasarga are not \ncategorized under any of word class, but Nipatha can be \ncategorized as closed class words based on their existence. \nIn-addition to that, Sinhala Pronouns can be classified as \nopen class words, based on their morphological properties, \nbut Pronouns also can be classified as closed class words, \nbased on their existence of fixed membership in the language.  \nIV. ANALYSIS OF MORPHOLOGICAL AND SYNTACTICAL \nFEATURES  \nNLP based language analysis mainly aid by morphological \nand syntactical features analysis of a language, and the \navailability of lexical resources is essential in this tasks. So \nhaving a corpus for a language is an important lexical \nresource in the field of NLP. In order to make the corpora \nmore useful for doing linguistic research, they are required to \nannotate with respective knowledge sources to make it \nsuitable to process with linguistics applications. One example \nof annotating a corpus is part of speech tagging, in which \ninformation about each word's part of speech (verb, noun, \nadjective, etc.) is added to the corpus in the form of tags. \nThe corpus that we use in this research is the beta version \nof the Corpus developed by the UCSC under PAN \nLocalization project in 2005 [7], which contains around 2754 \nsentences and 90551 words tagged with corresponding part of \nspeech tag, that comprise of data drawn from different kinds \nof Sinhala newspaper articles under different classifications, \nmainly form Art, Sports, Science, Indigenous knowledge and \nReligion.  \nWe performed a detailed analysis of the corpus to \nunderstand what rules govern the language and what patterns \noccur. Empirical results of the analysis is described in this \npaper in detail. A substantial effort was made at the corpus \npreparation phase to correct issues encountered in the \nformatting of the text in the corpus.   \n In order to further analysis of the corpus, word frequency \ndistribution and the tag frequency distribution were obtained \nfrom the corpus by running a simple tokenizing program. \nTags with typographical errors and irrelevant tokens \n(numbers, foreign words, etc.) were removed from the list \nafter manual inspection. \nA. Most Frequent Words in Sinhala Text Corpus \nThis analysis was performed to observe the words and Part \nof Speech categories that are more frequent in Sinhala text \ncorpus. In order to observe most frequent words, a distinct \nword list with frequencies were obtained from the corpus \nalong with possible part of speech tags. For simplicity, only \ntop 20 words were considered in the analysis. Table I \ncontains the list of words, with frequencies and possible part \nof speech categories. \nIt is observed that, most frequent words in Sinhala \nlanguage are function words, which belong to closed class \ncategory. 11 out of 20 words belong to Nipatha which all are \nfunction words, 6 frequent verbs are also within the list. It is \nalso observed that tagging ambiguity exists among high \nfrequent words, though they are function words. There are \ntwo words among top 20 words, “පත්” and “යුතු” that are not \nproperly classified into respective parts of speech categories.  \nB. Zipf’s Law Analysis \nZipf’s Law states that, the frequency of occurrence of an \ninstance of a class is roughly inversely proportional to the \nrank of that class in the frequency list, for example \noccurrences of words in a document. So the goal of this test \nwas to observe parts of speech distribution within Sinhala \nlanguage displays the Zipf’s Law behavior. \nSuppose that, a word occurs f times and that in the list of \nword frequencies it has a certain rank r, if Zipf's Law holds \nwe have (for all words) f = a/rb where a and b are constants \nand b is close to minus 1 (-1). Taking the logarithm of each \nside of the equation we get: \n \n3 \n \n  \n \n  \nTABLE I \nTHE TOP 20 MOST FREQUENT WORDS IN SINHALA LANGUAGE (REFER \nAPPENDIXES 1 FOR DESCRIPTION OF EACH TAG) \nWord \nFrequ. \nPossible POS tags \nMain POS \nCategory/s \nදී \n1089 \nPOST (1024), VNF \n(57), VNN, VP, RP \nNipatha - \nPostposition \nඇති \n632 \nVP (621), JVB (1) \nNipatha - Verb \nParticiple \nඅතර \n567 \nPOST (376), CC \n(191) \nNipatha - \nPostposition \nහා \n530 \nCC (526),POST (3) \nNipatha - \nConjunctions \nවූ \n436 \nVP (430), VNF (6) \nNipatha - Verb \nParticiple \nඇත \n429 \nVFM (409),VP \n(19),VNF \nVerb Finite Main \nසහ \n401 \nCC (401) \nNipatha - \nConjunctions \nමෙෙ \n370 \nDET (365),POST  \n(5) \nNipatha - Determiner \nවී \n355 \nVNF (340), VP \n(6),NNN, VNN, \nNNPA \nVerb Non Finite \nඔහු \n348 \nPRP (347),POST (1) \nPronoun \nකළ \n331 \nVP (304), VNF (24), \nVFM, NNN \nNipatha - Verb \nParticiple \nවිය \n313 \nVFM (194),VP \n(111), VNF, \nRP,NNN \nVerb Finite Main, \nVerb Participle \nකර \n307 \nVNF (302), VP (2), \nVFM, VNN \nVerb Non Finite \nපත් \n290 \n?

Maximum Likelihood Estimate of the Tag Distribution \nThe objective of this test is to observe the Likelihood \ndistribution of parts of speech tags in Sinhala text corpus and \nunderstand which tags are most likely to appear. Table III \ncontains tag distribution obtained from the corpus. Tag \nfrequency and number of distinct words with respect to each \ntag were counted from the corpus.

It is also noticed that more than 50% of words are \nnoun in the corpus, around 10% belongs to verbs/verbal \nparses. So in general, we can say around 60% of words in \nSinhala language are belong to open class type while around \n40% of words belongs to the closed class type. \nD. Words distribution by Tag \nThe objective of this test is to analyze, what type of words \nare exist mostly in Sinhala language.  Fig. III is plotted based \non data presented in Table III, which shows the distribution \nof number of distinct words by POS category in the corpus.  \nIt is observed that most of the words in Sinhala language are \nnouns, which is 13047 words are nouns out of total of 18957 \ndistinct words in the corpus, that is almost around 68% of the \ntotal number of words in the corpus.   \n \n \nFig. III Plot of word distribution by Tag  \nV. GUESSING PART OF SPEECH FOR UNKNOWN WORDS \nTagging data with unknown words is also an essential task \nin the tagger. When the system reach an unknown word, the \ninitial version of the tagger doesn’t cater unknown words, \nthus tagger fails to propose a tag since the system is not \ntrained for that word and the tagging algorithm doesn’t have \nenough intelligence to propose tags for untrained words.  \nSince Sinhala is a complex, morphologically rich and \nagglutinative \nlanguage, \nin \nwhich \ninformation \nabout \nmorphology or how word spelled is very difficult to use in \nunknown word prediction algorithms, unlike English.  So in \nour research, the important source of information that we \nhave used the distribution of words and parts of speech. So \nimprovements of the algorithm focused on words belong to \nsub categories of open class words, such as noun, verbs and \npronouns. Due to fixed number of membership in closed \nclass word category, we can assume that the words belong to \nclosed class category are well defined in Sinhala grammar \nand that is fixed. Hence, improvement could be done by \nincurring knowledge of distinction between closed class and \nopen class words. Syntactic knowledge can be used to aid in \nthe analysis of unknown words sentence structure. Then \nsuggest corresponding part of speech and calculate the \ntrigram using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for unknown \nwords. \nConsidering the fact that the tag likelihood distribution and \nthe word frequency distribution of the language, it is clear \nthat NNN is the most frequent part of speech in the language. \nThe NNN tag likelihood is the highest likelihood and it is 3 \ntimes greater than VP.  By considering word frequency \ndistribution by tags in Fig. III provide evidence that the most \nof the words in the language are NNNs, which is 5 times \nmore than NNPI. Based on above two factors, the simplest \nway that could handle unknown words, we can assume and \nguess NNN as part of speech tag for each new word \nencountered in the tagging process. \n  More advanced approach of guessing parts of speech is, \nthe consideration of the distinction between closed class and \nopen class words. This distinction can simplified the \nunknown \nprediction \nalgorithm \nby \ndistinguishing \nthe \n5 \n \n  \n \n  \nsyntactical categories into separate groups that can greatly \nsimplify the task of processing unknown words in a sentence.  \nClosed class parts of speech are those that have relatively \nfixed membership in the language and that may not normally \nbe assigned to new words. Closed class words are words with \na closed class part of speech. For example, words belong to \nNipatha in Sinhala language are the member of closed class, \nwhich has fixed membership in the language, it is very rare \nthat a new Conjunctions (CC), Determiners (DET) or \nPostpositions (POST) are added to the language. In addition \nto that words belong to Pronoun (PRP) are also considered as \nfixed in its existence in the language, and new Pronouns are \nvery rarely created. So, Pronouns are also considered as \nclosed class parts of speech in this research. Table IV \ncontains a list of parts of speech tags that are considered as \nclosed class categories in this research and will be avoided in \nguessing for unknown words. \nBased on morphological and syntactical features of \nSinhala language, open class words are comprised of words \nwith the following parts of speech: nouns, verbs, Noun in \nKriya Mula, and Adjective in Kriya Mula. Adjectives, \nadverbs and Verb Participle are also considered under this \nclassification in this research (Table V contains the complete \nlist of parts of speech tags considered as open class category), \nsince those words are syntactically used to modify nouns and \nverbs.  \nTABLE IV \nLIST OF CLOSED CLASS PARTS OF SPEECH CATEGORIES \nTag \nPart of Speech \nPRP \nPronoun Common \nDET  \nDeterminer \nRP  \nParticle \nPOST  \nPostpositions \nCC  \nConjunctions \n \nIn this research, we assume that each new word \nencountered in the part of speech tagging process of Sinhala \nlanguage belong to open word class category, hence the \nunknown word algorithm is to pretend that each unknown \nword is ambiguous among all open class part of speech tags, \nwith equal probability. Then the tagger computes the tag \nsequence probability and maximum likelihood probabilities \nrely on text corpus and suggest the proper tag.  Further, \nforeign words and numerals were handled separately, since \nthey do not form any syntactical relationship with other part \nof speech categories in the language. \nVI. EVALUATION \nThe evaluation of the system was mainly driven by \ntraining the system using the Sinhala text corpus that \ncomprised of 2754 sentences and 90551 words, in which data \ndrown from Sinhala newspaper articles from various genres.  \nFor the test data set, data were carefully selected aiming \nfor testing three different versions of the tagger. The first set \nwas collected from the training corpus aiming to test Version \n1 of the tagger that comprised of 621 words only known to \nthe system, and 36 sentences. The second test set was also \ncollected aiming to test Version 2 and 3 of the tagger, which \ndata were drown from Sinhala text corpus outside from the \ntrained data set. The second test set comprised of 51 \nsentences, 1024 words. Out of 1024 words, 171 words were \nunknown to the system. To evaluate the performance of the \ntagger, two gold standard test sets were created.  \nTABLE V \nLIST OF OPEN CLASS PARTS OF SPEECH TAGS \nTag \nPart of Speech \nNNM \nCommon Noun Masculine \nNNF \nCommon Noun Feminine \nNNN  \nCommon Noun Neuter \nNNPA  \nProper Noun Animate \nNNPI  \nProper Noun Inanimate \nVFM  \nVerb Finite Main \nVNF  \nVerb Non Finite \nVNN  \nVerbal Non Finite Noun \nNVB  \nNoun in Kriya Mula \nJVB  \nAdjective in Kriya Mula \nJJ  \nAdjective \nRB  \nAdverb \nVP \nVerb Participle  \n \nThe tagger evaluated by comparing the tagged output with \nthe Gold standard test set.  The accuracy was calculated using \nnumber of correct tags proposed by the system and total \nnumber of words in the sentence/s, by the following formula. \n \n \nVII. \nRESULT AND DISCUSSION \nThe performance of the tagger was measured, using three \ndifferent versions of progressively upgraded tagging \nmechanisms. Version 1 is the simplest form of the tagger that \nperforms well only with known words that rejects all \nunknown words as tagging failures. Version 2 is a somewhat \nupgraded version that treats all unknown words as nouns and \nsuggest NNN to each new word encountered in the tagging \nprocess. Version 3 is the full version of the tagger that uses \nstatistical technique to guess the best tag for unknown word \nby considering the context of surrounding words.  \n  Table VI shows our system’s performance for these three \ndifferent versions of tagging mechanisms and the experiment \nverifies the effectiveness of our unknown word guessing \ntechniques.  As shown by the performance of each tagging \napproach, Version 2 shows a drop in the accuracy, with \ncompared to other two versions. That indicates the approach \nfollowed in Version 2 in guessing parts of speech for \nunknown words is not a reliable method for Sinhala language. \nVersion 3 shows 91.50% of accuracy, that shows considering \nthe distinction between closed and open class in guessing part \nof speech for unknown words is proved to be useful and an \neffective way for Sinhala language.  \nFig. IV presents the confusion matrix, which summarized \nthe performance of Version 3 of the tagger,   where row \nlabels indicate the correct tags and column labels indicate the \n \n \n6 \n \ntags predicted by the system. In this confusion matrix, all \ncorrect predictions are located in the diagonal of the table. \nMost of the deviations are shown in predicting tags for words \nbelong to Common Noun Neuter category.  \nTABLE VI \nPERFORMANCE OF THE TAGGER \nApproach \nTagging Approach \nPerformance of \nthe Tagger \nVersion 1 \nOnly with known words \n91.30% \nVersion 2 \nAll unknown words \nconsidered as Common Noun \nNeuter (NNN) \n89.73% \nVersion 3 \nConsider distinction between \nclosed class and open class in \nguessing unknown words  \n91.50% \n \nHowever, the overall accuracy of the tagger have shown \nthat the distinction between closed class and open class word \ncategory is a power full tool in handling unknown words for \nSinhala language. But the tagging accuracy is still close to \n92%, and that shows more work need to be carried out to fine \ntune the accuracy of the tagger. So improvement can be \nsuggested to the tagger in handling unknown words. Mainly \nmorphological recognition can also be helpful in predicting \npossible parts of speech for many unknown words. So the \noverall performance of the tagger can be improved by using a \nhybrid approach, with incurring above knowledge to the \nsystem by set of hand written rules. Further to make sure this \napproach more accurate, the output generated by the system \nneed to be manually verified, and retraining the tagger to \nmake sure if the word encountered again later, that word \nwould get properly tagged. \n \nPOST NVB VP JJ RB RP VNF DET VNN PRP NNF JVB NNPA VFM NNN NNM NNPI CC\nPOST\n80\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n7\n0\n1\n0\nNVB\n0\n61\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n10\n0\n0\n0\nVP\n0\n0\n97\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\n5\n0\n0\n0\nJJ\n0\n0\n2 66\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n7\n0\n1\n0\nRB\n0\n0\n0\n0\n8\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nRP\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0 43\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nVNF\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\n57\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n4\n0\n0\n0\nDET\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n21\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\n0\n1\n0\nVNN\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n30\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\nPRP\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n24\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\nNNF\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nJVB\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n15\n0\n0\n2\n0\n1\n0\nNNPA\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n9\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\nVFM\n0\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n30\n1\n0\n0\n0\nNNN\n5\n1\n2\n2\n0\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\n0\n377\n0\n5\n0\nNNM\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\n27\n0\n0\nNNPI\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n9\n1\n58\n0\nCC\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0 18 \nFig. IV Confusion matrix of the test results \nVIII. \nCONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK \nIn this paper we have described two types of methods for \ndealing with unknown words in POS tagging Sinhala \nlanguage. The application of the methods in Hidden Markov \nModel based part of speech tagging approach (which we have \npreviously developed [1]) was evaluated and results were \npresented. The implementation was tested against 90551 \nwords, 2754 sentences of Sinhala text corpus and that showed \n91.5% accuracy in the tagging process with predicting tags to \nunknown words. So that the performance of the tagger prove \nthat distinction between closed class and open class words \nand syntactic knowledge are reliable sources of information \nfor handling unknown words in part of speech tagging of \nSinhala language.  \nThough this research proposed a reliable approach to \nhandle \nunknown \nwords \nin \nPOS \ntagging, \nfurther \nenhancements are required to improve and optimize the \nalgorithm. Hence, several directions are suggested here for \nfuture work. \n \nLanguage specific morphological features can be \nhelpful in predicting possible parts of speech for most \nof the verbs. \n \nIncorporation of named entity recognition techniques:   \ninformation about identifying named entity could be \npossible clue in predicting parts of speech for most of \nthe nouns. \n \nInstead of using only HMM, following a hybrid \napproach, with incurring above key knowledge to the \nsystem by a set of hand written rules. \n \nIncreasing the size of the corpus and accuracy of \ntagged data. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nWe express our immense gratitude and many thanks to Dr. \nHarsha Kumara for his invaluable support in providing an \ninitiative to this work.
