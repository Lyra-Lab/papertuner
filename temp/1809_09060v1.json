Multiple studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNN) often  \noutperform commonly used algorithms when applied to model in vitro bioactivity data, including \nSupport Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF)21,23,24. Importantly, the higher \npredictive power of deep learning has been shown for both large and small data sets13,19,20. \nHence, DNN are becoming a standard technique to model in vitro compound activity1,25. \n \nDefining the set of molecules for which a model can generate reliable predictions has been (and \nstill is26) an area of intense research because an accurate estimation of prediction errors is \nessential for a model to inform decision-making in drug discovery27–30. While diverse deep \nlearning architectures have been developed to predict compound activity as point \npredictions12,18,23, modelling prediction uncertainty for small molecules using deep learning still \nremains an unexplored area, and this is precisely what we address in this contribution. \n \nAmong the array of methods developed to compute the uncertainty of individual predictions, \nconformal prediction31,32 has been extensively applied in drug discovery over the last few years \nto model compound toxicity33, in vitro bioactivity data34–38, and to guide in silico iterative \nscreening campaigns.39,40 A key advantage of conformal prediction is that each prediction is \ngiven as a confidence interval, that will be more or less stringent depending on the user-\nselected confidence level (CL)31. Moreover, these predicted confidence regions are guaranteed \nto be valid by a solid mathematical foundation provided that the exchangeability principle is \nfulfilled, which is generally assumed to be the case when modelling bioactivity data31,32,36. The \nvalidity of a conformal predictor means that, at a user-defined CL, the measured error rate, i.e., \nthe fraction of instances for which the true value lies outside the predicted region, will not be \nlarger than the chosen error rate (i.e., 1 - CL). For instance, at a confidence level of 80%, at \nleast 80% of the predicted confidence regions will contain the true value. Thus, in contrast to \nmost other prediction error methods, which do not guarantee a lower bound for the fraction of \nthe predictions that will be correct, conformal prediction is a very powerful technique in practice; \n \n4 \nfor instance, in a drug discovery project it permits to select compounds for further experimental \ntesting while controlling for the fraction of instances whose experimentally measured bioactivity \nwill be above a cut-off value of interest36,39,40. \n \nAnother major advantage of conformal prediction is that, as opposed to e.g., Bayesian \nmethods41–45, it requires little computational cost beyond the training of the underlying \nalgorithms, no parameter optimization, and can be coupled to any machine learning algorithm36. \nIn the deep learning community, previous work on estimating predictive uncertainty for DNN \nused both Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches46–51. In addition, post-processing of the \nsoftmax layer, although it is not a measure of confidence52, has proved useful to deliver \ncalibrated class probabilities in classification problems53,54. However, to the best of our \nknowledge, the integration of conformal prediction and deep learning to model bioactivity data \nhas not been explored to date.  \n \nHere, we propose Deep Confidence, a versatile and computationally efficient framework to \ncompute confidence intervals for individual predictions. Deep Confidence leverages the key \nadvantages of both deep learning and conformal prediction, and can be easily integrated into \nany deep learning architecture. Deep Confidence uses Snapshot Ensembles55 to generate an \nensemble of DNN from the training of a single DNN. To generate a Snapshot Ensemble, \nintermediate states of a DNN during the optimization path of its parameters are taken (Figure 1). \nThe main advantage of Snapshot Ensembles is that these snapshots are ‘free’, given that no \nextra computation is required to generate them beyond the computation time needed to train the \nnetwork. The training phase is divided into cycles, throughout which the learning rate is \nannealed and set back to its original value at the beginning of the next cycle. At the end of a \ncycle, the current state of the DNN is used as a base learner in the Snapshot Ensemble \nprovided that the DNN has (sufficiently) converged to a local minimum during that cycle. \nConvergence is measured using the loss on the validation set, which in the current study was \nthe Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in prediction. A cut-off value related to the uncertainty of \nthe data at hand can be used to dismiss snapshots with low predictive power before the network \nstarts converging; for instance, 1.2 pIC50 units, which corresponds to about two times the \nexperimental uncertainty of public heterogeneous IC50 data56,57. Therefore, while the average \nerror in prediction might be similar across snapshots, the predictions for a given instance \ncalculated by each snapshot will be different55. The fact that the snapshot predictions are \n \n5 \ncorrelated but not identical adds sufficient diversity to generate an ensemble with high predictive \npower58. Once the Snapshot Ensemble has been generated, the predictions of each snapshot \non the validation and test sets are used to generate a conformal predictor.  \n \nWe here show using 24 diverse bioactivity data sets from ChEMBL version 23 (Table 1) that \nDeep Confidence generates valid confidence intervals, and that these span a narrower range of \nvalues than those calculated using RF-based conformal predictors while leading to a \ncomparable average interval size. In addition, we show that Snapshot Ensembles and \nensembles of independently trained DNN lead to comparable predictive power on unseen data \nduring the training phase. Thus, Deep Confidence represents a versatile approach to model \nbioactivity data using DNN ensembles at a vastly reduced computing cost while also providing \nan estimation of the reliability of individual predictions. \n \n \n \n6 \nMethods \n \nData Sets \nWe gathered IC50 data for 24 diverse protein targets and receptors from the ChEMBL database \nversion 23 using the chembl_webresource_client python module59–61. Only IC50 values for small \nmolecules that satisfied the following filtering criteria were retained: (i) an activity unit equal to \n“nM”, (ii) activity relationship equal to ‘=’, (iii) target type equal to “SINGLE PROTEIN”, and (iv) \norganism equal to Homo sapiens. IC50 values were modeled in a logarithmic scale (pIC50 = \n−log10 IC50). The average pIC50 value was calculated when multiple pIC50 values were available \nfor the same compound. Further information about the data sets is given in Table 1 and in 62. All \ndata sets are provided in the Supporting Information. \n \nTable 1.

Inorganic molecules were \nremoved, and the largest fragment was kept in order to filter out counterions. We next computed \ncircular Morgan fingerprints63 for all compounds using RDkit (release version 2013.03.02)64. The \nradius was set to 2 and the fingerprint length to 128. In contrast to previous work65–67, we \nobserved that longer fingerprints (256, 512 and 1024 bits) led to marginal increases in predictive \npower, and hence, we used 128 bits to reduce training times. \n \nMachine Learning \nIn the following subsections, we explain the training procedures of the 5 learning strategies \nexplored in this study and how conformal predictors were generated for each of them. For each \ntraining strategy and data set pair 20 repeats were performed, each time randomly assigning \ndifferent sets of data points to the training, validation and test sets.  \n \n- \nDeep Neural Networks (DNN) \nDNN were trained using the python library Pytorch68. The RMSE value on the validation set was \nused as the loss function during the training of all DNNs reported here. We defined three hidden \nlayers, composed of 60, 20, and 10 nodes, respectively, and used rectified linear unit (ReLU) \nactivation. We decided to use ReLU activation following previous work where higher predictive \npower was obtained with ReLU as compared to the Tanh and Sigmoid functions18. We set the \nnumber of nodes in each layer below the number of dimensions of the input data, i.e. 128, to \nreduce the risk of overfitting69.  \n \nThe data sets were randomly split into a training set (70% of the data), a validation set (15%), \nand a test set (15%). For each data set, the training set was used to train a given network, \nwhereas the validation set served to monitor the performance of the network during the training \nphase. The training data were processed in batches of size equal to 15% of the number of \ninstances, as using larger batches during training decreases the generalization ability of the \nmodels70. The test set was used to assess the generalization capabilities of the models on \nunseen data during the training phase.  \n \nWe used stochastic gradient descent with Nesterov momentum, which was set to 0.9 and kept \nconstant during the training phase71. We allowed the networks to evolve over 3,000 epochs. To \navoid overfitting we used early stopping, i.e., the training of a given network was stopped if the \n \n8 \nvalidation loss did not decrease after 200 epochs. In addition, we used 10% dropout in the three \nhidden layers13,18,72. The DNN described in the following sections were trained using the \nparameter values and data partitions described above unless otherwise stated. \n \n- \nEnsembles of Deep Neural Networks  \nWe considered 2 strategies to generate ensembles of DNNs. Each ensemble encompassed 100 \nDNN as base learners, each of them trained using the same validation and training sets. The \npoint prediction for a given instance was calculated as the mean value of the 100 individual \npredictions.  \n \nEnsembles of Independently Trained Deep Neural Networks (DNN Ensemble). The base \nlearners in this case were 100 DNN independently trained using the same deep learning \narchitecture. This corresponds to training the same type of DNN on the same training data, \nusing different seed values at the start of the training phase. DNNs that failed to converge to \nRMSE values on the validation set smaller than 1.2 pIC50 units were discarded and not \nconsidered in the ensemble. After reaching convergence in the training phase, each DNN was \nused to predict the activity for both the validation and test sets. The learning rate was initially set \nto 0.005, and was decreased by 40% every 200 epochs. \n \nSnapshot Ensembles with learning rate annealing (Snapshot Ensemble Lr Annealing). \nSnapshot Ensembles were constructed by recording DNN snapshots55 during the training phase \nof a single DNN. This allows to generate multiple models, each corresponding to a different \nlocal minimum, while only training one DNN55. Each of these snapshots served as a base \nlearner to generate a given Snapshot Ensemble (Figure 1 and 2). Early stopping was not used \nin this case. The learning rate was set back to the initial value (i.e., 0.005) after the completion \nof each cycle. During each cycle, the learning rate was annealed using step decay (the exact \nparameter values used are defined below). Setting back the learning rate to a high value (where \nhigh depends on the data sets being modelled) allows wider sampling of the loss landscape and \nto escape from local minima73,74 (Figure 1 and 2).  \n \nIn some cases, convergence was not achieved after the 3,000 epochs we used to train each \nnetwork or started after few learning rate annealing cycles. We found that the loss on the \nvalidation set was either too high, indicating that no local minima were reached, or the \npredictions for the validation set were simply the mean pIC50 value of the instances in the \n \n9 \ntraining data. Although the average error in prediction for the latter might be <1.2 pIC50 units \n(e.g., in cases where inactive data points abound), their generalization ability is limited. \nTherefore, these DNN were discarded and not used to generate Snapshot Ensembles. In cases \nwhere convergence was indeed achieved, we only kept snapshots with high predictive power; \nthat is, leading to RMSE values on the validation set smaller than 1.2 pIC50 units. The training \nphase of each Snapshot Ensemble stopped once 100 snapshots with a validation RMSE < 1.2 \npIC50 units were taken. The 100 snapshots were used to predict the activity for both the \nvalidation and test sets. \n \nWe defined three implementations of this scheme, each of them differing in (i) the number of \nepochs per cycle, (ii) epoch intervals at which snapshots were taken, and (iii) the step size in \nthe learning rate decay function: \n \n- \nSnapshot Ensemble Lr Annealing 1: a snapshot was taken every 50 epochs, each \ncycle consisted of 50 epochs, and the learning rate was decreased by 40% every 10 \nepochs \n- \nSnapshot Ensemble Lr Annealing 2: a snapshot was taken every 25 epochs, each \ncycle consisted of 250 epochs, and the learning rate was decreased by 40% every 10 \nepochs.  \n- \nSnapshot Ensemble Lr Annealing 3: a snapshot was taken every 50 epochs, each \ncycle consisted of 250 epochs, and the learning rate was decreased by 40% every 50 \nepochs.  \n \n- \nRandom Forests (RF) \nRF models were trained using the python library scikit learn75. The default parameter values \nwere used except for the number of trees, which was set to 100 given that higher values do not \ngenerally lead to increased performance when modelling bioactivity data37,76. Another reason to \nconsider 100 trees was to ensure that the same number of base learners is used to generate \nRF and DNN ensembles. The same data set splits used to train DNN were used to train RF \nmodels. Specifically, RF models were trained on the training set (70% of the data), and the \npredictive power assessed on the test set (15%). \n \nConformal Prediction \n \n \n10 \n- \nEnsembles of DNN \nWe describe below the main steps to generate conformal predictors using ensembles of DNN. \nFor further theoretical details about the conformal prediction framework we refer the reader to \n31,32,36.  \nThe residuals and the standard deviation across a given DNN ensemble, be it a Snapshot \nEnsemble or a DNN Ensemble, served to generate a list of non-conformity values for the \nvalidation set as follows (Figure 1B): \nEquation 1:      ∝-= \n|𝑦- −𝑦23|\n𝑒56\n \nwhere 𝑦- is the ith instance in the validation set, 𝑦23 is the average of the predicted activities for \nthe ith instance across the ensemble, and 𝜎- is the standard deviation of the activity predictions \nacross the ensemble. The resulting list of non-conformity scores, 𝛼, was sorted in increasing \norder, and the percentile corresponding to the CL considered was selected, e.g., 𝛼9: for the 80th \npercentile. The validation residuals across the 20 runs of each learning strategy and data set \ncombination were used to generate the list of non-conformity values. \n \nNormalizing the residuals is a widely used method to generate tighter predictions for instances \nthat are easier to predict, as reflected by a lower variance across the ensemble36,77. We decided \nto use the natural exponential of the standard deviation across the ensemble to scale the \nresiduals because previous studies showed that this approach slightly improves the efficiency of \nconformal predictors built on bioactivity data sets78. Basically, this scaling sets the upper value \nfor the list of non-conformity values to be equal to the largest residual in the validation set, as \nthe exponential converts low 𝜎- values to ~1. This is useful in practice to prevent large non-\nconformity values. For instance, a very large non-conformity value would be obtained for a very \nbiased prediction (i.e., large difference between the predicted and the true value), and \ndisplaying low variance (i.e., low variability across the base learners). This situation would occur \nin e.g., the presence of activity cliffs79. \n \nThe standard deviation across the ensemble served to calculate confidence regions for \nindividual instances in the test set as follows: \n \nEquation 2:      𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑖𝑜𝑛= 𝑦E3 ± G𝑦H −𝑦E3 G = 𝑦E3 ± (𝑒5J ∗ 𝛼LM) \n \n \n11 \nwhere 𝑦H is the jth instance in the test set, 𝑦E3 is the average of the predicted activities for the jth \ninstance across the ensemble, and 𝜎H is the standard deviation of the predicted activities across \nthe ensemble. \n \n- \nRandom Forests \nWe also used Random Forests as a baseline comparison, in order to evaluate whether the \nconformal predictors generated using ensembles of DNNs lead to higher predictive power and \ntighter confidence intervals than the state of the art. In the case of RF, cross-conformal \npredictors were generated as previously reported35,80. In brief, RF models were trained on the \ntraining data using 10-fold cross validation. The cross-validation residuals and the standard \ndeviation across the forest were used to calculate the list of non-conformity values37,78.  \n \n12 \nResults and Discussion \nWe firstly evaluated the performance of the different ensemble strategies considered in this \nstudy. Overall, the performance of RF, DNN Ensembles, and the three Snapshot Ensembles we \ndefined was comparable on the 24 data sets used in the current study (P > 0.05; Kruskal–Wallis \ntest), with mean RMSE values on the test set across repetitions in the 0.6-0.9 pIC50 units range \n(Figure 3). These values are consistent with the expected errors in prediction for models built \nusing heterogeneous IC50 data from ChEMBL56,57. We furthermore observed a variability of 0.05-\n0.15 pIC50 units across the three Snapshot Ensembles for each data set (Figure 3). The \ncomparable errors in prediction on the test set shows that Snapshot Ensembles performed on \npar with RF and DNN Ensembles. These results thus indicate that the deep learning \narchitectures and parameter values we used to train the four types of DNN ensembles explored \nin this study are suitable to model these data sets. \nTo examine the variability of the predictions across snapshots, we computed the correlation \nbetween the predictions on the test set for each pair of snapshots in the Snapshot Ensembles, \nand for the independently trained DNNs that form the Ensemble DNN (Figure 4 and S1-23). The \ntest set predictions calculated by most of the DNN are less correlated in the Ensemble DNN \n(Figure 4A) than in the Snapshot Ensembles (Figure 4B-D). This is expected because the base \nlearners in the Ensemble DNN are trained independently, whereas the snapshots are taken \nthroughout the training phase of a single neural network. However, we note that the lowest \nPearson correlation observed for the Ensemble DNN predictions ( i.e., ~0.92; Figure 3A; see \nFigures S1-23 for the remaining data sets) is also observed for the Snapshot Ensembles. In the \ncase of Snapshot Ensembles, we also observe that the predictions on the test set are less \ncorrelated to the first annealing cycle (i.e., first snapshot) as the training phase advances. This \nis indicated in Figure 4B-D by the transition from green to brown across the x and y-axes (see \nalso Figures S1-23). This indicates that during the training phase of Snapshot Ensembles \nmultiple local minima are explored, each of them exhibiting different error profiles, thus helping \nto increase the diversity in the final ensemble. The predictions for the Snapshots taken \nthroughout each learning rate annealing cycle (i.e, Snapshot Ensemble Lr Annealing 2-3), are \nmore correlated than those extracted from other learning cycles, as evidenced by the dark \ngreen squares in the diagonal of Figure 4C-D. Note that this pattern is not observed for \nSnapshot Ensemble Lr Annealing 1 (Figure 4A), where each snapshot was taken at the end of \n \n13 \neach annealing cycle. Thus, the high predictive power of each snapshot on the test set, as well \nas the variability of the predictions across the ensembles, suggest that the snapshots in the \nSnapshot Ensembles converged to multiple high-quality local minima81. \nNext, we sought to investigate the validity of the conformal predictors generated using DNN \nEnsembles and Snapshot Ensembles. To this end, we computed the percentage of instances in \nthe test set whose true values lie within the predicted confidence regions. For a conformal \npredictor to be valid, this fraction needs to be equal to or greater than the selected confidence \nlevel. The conformal predictors are valid for all data sets and learning strategies explored, as \nindicated by the high correlation between increasingly higher confidence levels and the \npercentage of confidence intervals encompassing the true bioactivity value (R2 > 0.99, P < \n0.001; Figures 5 and S24). Together, these results indicate that the four types of DNN-based \nensembles considered here can be used to generate valid conformal predictors. \nThe second critical aspect of a conformal predictor is the efficiency of the predicted confidence \nregions. Following the terminology used in the conformal prediction literature36, we use the term \nefficiency to refer to the average size of the predicted confidence intervals across models. The \nnarrower the confidence intervals, the more efficient a conformal predictor is. Conformal \npredictors generating large intervals might be theoretically valid, but such wide errors bars \nwould provide little practical information about which compounds to prioritize for further \nexperimental testing in a real-world situation. Thus, we next compared the size of the \nconfidence regions predicted by the conformal predictors based on RF, DNN Ensembles, and \nSnapshot Ensembles. \nThe average size of the confidence regions is overall comparable across data sets for RF and \nDNN Ensemble models, and slightly higher for Snapshot Ensembles (Figure 6). The average \nsize over the 20 repetitions of the confidence intervals is in the 0.8-1.2 pIC50 range for all \nlearning strategies and data sets. These values are comparable to those previously obtained for \nother bioactivity data sets36,78, and are narrow enough to be practically useful for compound \nprioritization in most cases. Notably, the RF-based conformal predictors span a wider range of \nvalues, leading to confidence intervals larger than 6 pIC50 units in some cases (Figure 6). \nAlthough the spread of the distribution is larger for those Snapshot Ensembles with lower \npredictive power on the test set (Figure 3), at least one Snapshot Ensemble leads to a tighter \n \n14 \ndistribution for all data sets (Figure 6). This indicates that, although robust conformal predictors \ncan be generated using Deep Confidence, the parameterization of the underlying networks \nneeds to be optimized for each individual data set. \nThe fact that the confidence intervals calculated with RF span a wider range of values (Figure 6) \nindicates that the predictions of the individual trees in the Forest are poorly correlated for some \ninstances (i.e., high variance across the ensemble), and highly correlated for others (i.e., low \nvariance). High variance across the ensemble leads to larger confidence intervals (Equation 2). \nIn contrast, the confidence intervals for molecules for which the predictions across base \nlearners are highly correlated, and hence display a lower variance, are tighter. Thus, lower \nvariance across the ensemble should be reflected in more narrowly contained distributions of \nintervals sizes82. Analysis of the distributions of the standard deviation across the ensemble for \nthe predictions on the test set confirms that the RF models display larger variance than DNN-\nbased ensembles, with mean values for RF around 3 times larger (Figure 7), thus explaining the \ndifferences observed in Figure 6. \nThe validity of conformal predictors is guaranteed for the entire set of predictions, i.e., global \nvalidity36. However, the local validity, e.g., the validity of a conformal predictor if measured using \ndata within a certain bioactivity range only, might not always be fulfilled. This is particularly \nimportant because the goal of most discovery projects is to find highly active compounds, and \nhence, guaranteeing that the error rates are correct for particular bioactivity ranges is of utmost \nimportance. To further examine the local validity of the DNN-based conformal predictors, we \ncalculated the error rate at confidence level 0.8 for each pIC50 unit bin, using the experimentally \nmeasured pIC50 values for binning the instances in the test set. We find that the error rate is \naround the expected value (0.20 in this case; i.e., 1 - 0.8) for most conformal predictors and \ndata sets in the low micromolar and high nanomolar ranges (i.e., pIC50 of 5-7), although notable \nexceptions are present, e.g., data sets Caspase, COX-2, or HERG (Figures 8-9 and S25-26). \nAlthough not consistently, RF often shows a higher error rate for particular pIC50 bins (see e.g., \ndata sets Ephrin and erbB1 in Figure 9). We note that the error rates are higher for regions with \nfewer instances, which correspond for most data sets to the high activity range. Future work will \nbe needed to develop methods to guarantee the local validity for the high activity range, which is \nusually the range of interest and the one with fewer training instances. Together, these results \nindicate that the errors measured for DDN-based conformal predictors are more even than for \n \n15 \nRF-based ones, as evidenced by the lower spread of the distributions of confidence intervals \nand, in some cases, the more evenly distributed error rates across pIC50 bins. \nOverall, we have shown here that it is possible to generate highly predictive models and valid \nconformal predictors using DNN Snapshot Ensembles. Of practical relevance to predictive \nmodelling in drug discovery38, the derived confidence intervals display a smaller spread than \nthat of RF-based conformal predictors. The performance for ensembles of independently trained \nDNN and Snapshot Ensembles is comparable. Thus, the framework proposed here is \ncomputationally efficient in that it just requires the training of a single neural network to generate \nconfidence intervals. The parameter values used were found to work well on these data sets, \ngiven that model performance was in line with previously published analyses. However, further \ntuning of the deep learning architecture or the parameters would be advised for other learning \ntasks, data sets or compound descriptors13,18.  \nWe also stress that the potential of deep learning has not been fully exploited in this work due to \nthe limited size of the data sets used. Although the performance of DNN ensembles and RF on \nthese data sets is comparable, DNN will likely outperform RF on larger data sets23. It is precisely \nfor the modelling of large data sets that the framework proposed here will prove more versatile \nto leverage both the increased predictive power of deep learning and the estimation of \nprediction reliability using conformal prediction, while requiring minimal extra computation. While \nthe generation of snapshots during the training of a DNN requires no extra computation, we \nstress the fact that additional computation might be required to generate a Snapshot Ensemble \nif the network converges to high-quality local minimum before the number of epochs required to \ngenerate 100 snapshots is reached. This is however unlikely given that the global minimum is \nalmost never reached in practice for deep architectures. We also note that the complexity of the \nloss landscape increases for deeper architectures83, and hence, sampling multiple local minima \nto generate a Snapshot Ensemble might require a more sophisticated learning rate annealing \nschedule in those cases. Future work will also be required to comprehensively evaluate whether \nthe exhaustive sampling of local minima in the loss landscape leads to more efficient conformal \npredictors, as opposed to the sampling of a reduced set of these generating correlated \npredictions, or just sampling the vicinity of few local minima81. \n \n \n \n16 \nConclusions \nIn this work we introduced Deep Confidence, a framework to compute valid and efficient \nconfidence intervals for deep neural networks that requires no extra computational cost. \nSpecifically, we have shown that snapshots taken throughout the training of a single neural \nnetwork and corresponding to different local minima provide sufficient information to predict \nconfidence regions that are narrower than those calculated with RF-based conformal predictors. \nTherefore, the framework proposed in this study has great potential to increase the application \nof deep neural architectures in early-stage drug discovery while also controlling for the reliability \nof individual predictions. \n \n \n \n17 \nFigures \nFigure 1 Deep Confidence workflow. Illustration of the generation of a Snapshot Ensemble \nfrom the training of a single deep neural network (A), and the workflow proposed in this study to \ngenerate conformal predictors from Snapshot Ensembles (B). \nFigure 2  Loss on the validation set during the training of DNN using cyclical learning \nrate annealing. Evolution of the loss (shown in black, and corresponding to the RMSE for the \nobserved against the predicted values for the validation set), best loss for each learning rate \nannealing cycle of 250 epochs (red), and the learning rate (shown in blue and annealed using \nstep decay) for three representative data sets and across the first 1,500 epochs of the training \nphase. This learning rate annealing scheme corresponds to the learning strategy referred to in \nthe text as Snapshot Ensemble Adjust Lr 3. It can be seen that the loss converges to a local \nminimum during each learning rate annealing cycle of 250 epochs, throughout which the \nlearning rate is decreased by 40% every 50 epochs. It can be seen in (C) that the loss on the \nvalidation set decreases after multiple learning rate annealing cycles. \nFigure 3  Performance on the test set. Mean RMSE values (+/- standard deviation) on the test \nset across 20 runs for RF, DNN Ensembles, and Snapshot Ensembles are shown. Overall, the \nthree types of Snapshot Ensembles considered showed high predictive power on the test data, \nindicating that the choice of parameter values is suitable for modelling these data sets. The \ncolor scheme used in this Figure is also used throughout subsequent figures in the manuscript. \nFigure 4 Analysis of the correlation of the base learner predictions on the test set for \nEnsemble DNN and Snapshot Ensembles (data set A2a). The pairwise correlation of the test \nset predictions was calculated for each pair of base learners forming the Ensemble DNN (A) \nand the three types of Snapshot Ensembles we defined (B-C). The correlation matrices were \ncalculated using the predictions on the test set for the 20 repetitions. Overall, the test set \npredictions calculated by each DNN are less correlated in the Ensemble DNN than in the \nSnapshot Ensembles. This is expected given that the base DNN in the Ensemble DNN are \nindependently trained. The dark green squares in the diagonal in C and D indicate that the \npredictions calculated with snapshots extracted from the same learning rate annealing cycle are \nmore correlated than those extracted from other learning cycles. The transition from green to \nbrown across the training phase observed for Snapshot Ensembles indicates that multiple local \nminima are explored in each annealing cycle throughout the training phase, and hence, the \npredictions on the test set are less correlated to the first annealing cycle as the training phase \nadvances. A similar analysis for the other data sets is provided in Figures S1-23. \nFigure 5  Validity analysis. Each plot shows the correlation between the confidence level and \nthe percentage of predictions whose true value is contained within the predicted intervals for the \nconformal predictors built on 4 representative data sets using RF (A), DNN Ensembles (B), and \nSnapshot Ensembles Adjust Lr 1-3 (C-E). It can be seen that valid models were obtained \nbecause the percentage of predictions whose true value lies within the predicted confidence \nregion (1- error rate) strongly correlates with the confidence level. The validity analysis for the \nremaining data sets is provided in Figure S24. \nFigure 6  Analysis of the distribution of the confidence intervals. Each box plot shows the \ndistribution of the size of the confidence intervals (in pIC50 units) calculated for the test set at \n \n18 \nconfidence level 80%. The predictions for the 20 runs are shown. Overall, it can be seen that \nthe spread of the distributions for DNN-based methods is smaller, while the average size for the \nconfidence regions is marginally higher, compared to RF. \nFigure 7  Ensemble variance analysis. Distributions of the standard deviation across the \nensemble for the test set instances are shown across the 20 runs. Overall, it can be seen that \nthe variance across the ensemble is significantly larger for RF as compared to DNN-based \nensembles. This affects the spread of the distribution of intervals sizes, as shown in Figure 5. \nFigure 8  Analysis of the error rate across pIC50 bins. The error rates calculated for those \ninstances in the test set with an observed pIC50 value in the range indicated in the x-axis at \nconfidence level 80% are shown. The horizontal line indicates the expected error rate. \nAccording to the expected error rate, all points should be below the line. Points over the \nhorizontal line indicate that the error rate is higher that the indicated by the chosen confidence \nlevel. The area of the dot shapes is proportional to the number of instances in each pIC50 bin. \nOverall, it can be seen that even if the global validity is kept (i.e., the error rate for all test set \ninstances corresponds to the expected error rate for the selected confidence level; see Figure \n5), the validity across pIC50 bins varies considerably. The same analysis for the other data sets \nis provided in Figure 9. \nFigure 9  Analysis of the error rate across pIC50 bins for the remaining data sets. The error \nrates calculated for those instances in the test set with an observed pIC50 value in the range \nindicated in the x-axis at confidence level 80% are shown. The horizontal line indicates the \nexpected error rate. See also Figure 8. \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \nAuthor Contributions \nI.C.-C. designed research, trained the models, and analyzed the results.
