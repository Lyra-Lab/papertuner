INTRODUCTION \nAcoustic speech recognition (ASR) has already become one of the \nmost successful techniques in the era of artificial intelligence (AI) \n[1], [2]. However, millions of people around the world who lost \ntheir abilities to speak cannot enjoy the convenience of ASR [3]. \nUnder certain circumstances such as large background noise or high \nconfidential communications, ASR may lose its advantage or even \ndoesn’t work [4].  \nOne possible solution is the silent speech recognition (SSR) which \nis an alternative for these situations [5], [6]. Many biological \nindicators has been used as the input for the SSR among which \nelectroencephalography (EEG) is the most promising one [7]–[11]. \nEEG is a measure of electrical potentials between different \nlocations on the skull. Krishna et.al showed that using EEG can \nhelp ASR systems overcome performance loss in the presence of \nnoise [12]. Some studies have also reported that it is possible to \ndecipher imagined speech directly through EEG [13]. Although a \nhuge progress has been made in EEG-based SSR, it is impossible \nto evaluated the performances of different systems due to the lack \nof a consensus text corpus for SSR. \nIn the process of constructing EEG-based SSR text data sets, \nvarious NLP methods play an important role. Many methods for \nattention and neural sequence-to-sequence framework have been \nproposed [14]-[19]. A method has been proposed that of word-\nbased and character-based sequence-to-sequence models[20]. This \nmodel is utilized for data-to-text natural language generation. \nBERT has been successfully applied to a variety of natural \nlanguage processing tasks such as name entity recognition and \nmachine reading comprehensions[21]-[25]. The literature [26] first \nproposed to extend the BERT to the sequence generation task, and \nconstructed a new natural language generation model based on the \npre-training language model. In order to take full advantage of the \nBERT's context modeling capabilities, the proposed method uses a \ntwo-stage decoding process. \n2. TEXT CORPUS FOR SSR \nIn the field of general speech recognition, there are a large number \nof mature text corpus available. These texts are organized and \ncomplete. The content covers all aspects and application fields of \ndaily conversation. Based on these extensive text corpus, it can be \nfurther constructed a rich speech training set for general speech \nrecognition. \nDifferent from the general speech recognition application, the \ndesign and construction of training corpus is a challenging task in \nthe field of SSR, because Using EEG as a biomarker for speech \ndecoding has been popular for SSR. We want to build an SSR \nsystem based on EEG. Then, there is no ready-made ‘EEG-text pair' \ndata set that can be used for model training. We must build such a \ndata set almost from zero. Quantitatively, if you want to build an \navailable system similar to general speech recognition, then the \namount of data required must be cumulative tens of thousands of \nhours of 'EEG-text pair' data sets. For most academic teams, this is \na daunting task that requires a lot of manpower, material and time.  \n3. HYBRID MODELS FOR TEXT CORPUS \n3.1 Task-Oriented Text Corpus \nIn order to solve the above dilemma, we can choose a compromise \napproach, considering that in application, the essential needs of \nSSR are those patients who lose their throat vocal function due to \nillness. Their outstanding scenario for SSR applications is life \nsupport. Therefore, based on this consideration, we avoid the need \nfor a massive ‘EEG-text pair’ data set from the generic scenario \nSAMPLE: Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this \nwork for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that \ncopies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and \nthat copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

We start with the help of this task-oriented scene to construct \nthe task-oriented text corpus. In this way, the demand for data set \nsize is significantly reduced. Therefore, we need to construct \nsession texts that serve the life support class in a targeted manner. \nSuch texts will be further applied to the EEG signal data collection \nprocess to construct a task-oriented ‘EEG-text pair’ data set. \nThe characteristics of the life-assisted task-oriented session text is \nthat the task-oriented session has a clear purpose relative to the \nopen domain session, requiring high language quality and clear \nstructure. Moreover, with the language habits and language styles \nof different users, the language presents richness and diversity in a \ntask-oriented session. The special requirements of this kind of task-\noriented session text construction bring new challenges to the \ndesign and construction of our data set. \nwe adopt a task-oriented corpus hybrid construction method based \non natural language generation algorithm. The algorithm focuses \non the strategy of data-to-text generation[20], and has the following \ntwo advantages, the first one is linguistic quality based on template-\nbased method and the second is high diversity based on deep neural \nnetworks. \n3.2 Task-Oriented Hybrid Models \nThe literature [20] based on the neural network method realizes the \ndata-to-text natural langual generation. Inspired by this method, we \nconstruct a task-oriented hybrid construction method based on \nnatural language generation algorithm. This method is used to \ngenerate task-oriented text corpus in the field of SSR. The \nalgorithm includes two aspects, first constructing the seed text \ncorpus, then generate task-oriented text corpus based on the seed \ntext corpus using the deep neural network method. \nThe task-oriented hybrid models are used to construct the corpus. \nSpecific steps are as follows. \nStep 1. According to the requirements applied to the life aid class, \ndesign the corresponding cycle template, the template needs to be \nconcise and regular, and can basically cover the life assisted scene, \nwith the focus on the relevant high frequency words. \nStep 2. Construct the seed text corpus 𝐶\"##$ based on the cycle \ntemplate of natural language generation method. \nStep 3. The scale of the seed text corpus needs to be properly \ncontrolled. The corpus quality is used as a criterion to control the \nscale, and the scale adjustment can be returned to the step 2 iterative \nupdate. \nStep 4. The step 3 result is judged manually, mainly due to the \nfollowing considerations. The scale of the seed text corpus here is \nstrictly controlled to a small extent, and we have relatively high \nquality requirements for the seed text corpus. \nStep 5. Using the seed textcorpus as a training set, training based \non the deep neural network model, the model 𝑀& is obtained. \nStep 6. Based on the model 𝑀&. Further inference, get the final \nmeet-required task-oriented corpus 𝐶'(. \nStep 7. The task-oriented corpus 𝐶'( generated in step6 may not \nnecessarily meet the requirements in some cases. For example, in \nthe high diversity aspect, we need to go back to step5 and further \niterate and optimize until it meets the requirements. \n3.3 Constructing Seeds Text Corpus \n \n \nFigure 1. seed lexicon \n \nIn this section, we introduce the method of constructing the seed \nText Corpus. \nStep 1. Limit the scope of life scenes \nStep 2. According to the word frequency, extract common nouns, \nverbs, adjectives and quantifiers from the established scenes to \nform a seed lexicon, as shown in Figure 1. \nStep 3. According to the rule structure of grammatical subject, \npredicate and object, the corresponding vocabulary is extracted \nfrom the seed lexicon to form a sentence. \nStep 4. The statement is expanded to include appropriate \nquantifiers and adjectives before the corresponding nouns. \nExample: \na1. I want to wear a coat \na2. I want to wear a long coat \na3. I want to wear a long coat with velvet \nb1. He wants to drink water \nb2. He wants to drink a glass of water \nb3. He wants to drink a cup of warm water. \nb4. He wants to drink a cup of warm water with sugar. \n3.4 Constructing Text Corpus Based on Deep \nNeural Networks NLG Method \nIn this section, we designed the NLG model to implement non-fixed \nlength input and generate non-fixed length output text. We need to \nconstruct the sequence-to-sequence structure. First implement \nembeddings for inputting non-fixed length text.  \nWe use BERT[25][26] to implement the encoding function, where \nthe BERT stands for means bidirectional encoder representations \nfrom transformers. In the process of using BERT, Due to the use of \nlanguage models for transformer learning, empirical improvements \nhave shown that unsupervised pre-training is an important integral \npart of many natural language processing systems. The BERT \nmethod suggests that a general language model may exist. Prior to \nthis, when people solved NLP problems, they often customized \nspecific models for specific problems. Howerver, BERT \nsuccessfully solves a wide range of NLP tasks. Based on the above \ndescription,  our structure is shown in Figure 2. \n \nFigure 2. Embedding based on BERT \n \nBased on the idea of these literature [20][27]-[29], We implement \nthe natural language generation transformer model for specific text \nto text.  Furthermore, we have adopted a method based on these \ndocuments[30]-[33]. The detailed process is described below. The \nbasic structure of LSTM is as follows. Where 𝜍*, 𝜁*, 𝜉* and 𝜓* \nrepresent input gate, forget gate, output gate and memory cell, \nrespectively.  \n \n𝜍* = σ0Ξ2ℜ*45 + ℑ2𝜗9: + 𝛽2< \n𝜁* = σ(Ξ>ℜ*45 + ℑ>𝜗9: + 𝛽>) \n𝜉* = σ(Ξ@ℜ*45 + ℑ@𝜗9: + 𝛽@) \n𝜑* = tanh(ΞFℜ*45 + ℑF𝜗9: + 𝛽F) \nψ* = 𝜁* ⨀ ψ*45 + 𝜍* ⨀ 𝜑* \nℜ* = 𝜉* ⨀ 𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(ψ*) \n \nWhere 𝜗9: stand for the embedding of input. Ξ and ℑ stand for \ncorresponding matrix, and  β represent bias. They are all trainable \nparameters. ℜ* stand for the hidden state of LSTM. \nUtilizing bi-directional LSTM structure[31], we can extract text \ncontext information from both forward and backward directions. \nThe hidden state can be expressed as follows. \n \nℜ* = ℜO: ⨁ ℜQ: \n \nwhere ℜO: and ℜQ: represent hidden state of backward direction \nand hidden state of forward direction, respectively. and ⨁ stands \nfor the concat operation. \nOutput text sequence ℒ5,ℒT,. . . , ℒ( ，has a defined generation \nrule[20][34]. The elements ℒV, (𝑘= 1,2,⋯, 𝑁) are generated as \nfollows. \n \n       p(ℒV|ℒ5ℒT ⋯ℒV45) = 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(W( \n                                             ∑\n((𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑠V𝒲ℜ#))\nf\n#g5\nℜ#))) \n   \nWhere 𝑠V has the following representation. \n \n            𝑠V = 𝑏𝑖~𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀((𝑊op*(ℒV45) \n                     ⨁∑\n((𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑠V45𝒲ℜ#))\nf\n#g5\nℜ#)),𝑠V45) \n \nWherein, input text sequence 𝜗9 = (𝜗9q, 𝜗9r, ⋯, 𝜗9s ). where \nW , 𝒲 and 𝑊op*  represent output matrix, attention matrix and \noutput embedding matrices, respectively. \n \n4. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS \nBased on the methods presented in Sections 3.3 and 3.4, we \ncombine the above two methods to construct a hybrid algorithm for \ntask-oriented corpus. \nTask-oriented hybrid model can learn to express structured input in \nan appropriate way. These advantages mainly come from the \nexquisite and elegant seeds text corpus design and deep neural \nnetworks natural language generation method. The hybrid model \nhas two advantages including linguistic quality and high diversity. \nIn the field of SSR experiment, analysis results show that the \nperformance of our hybrid model outperforms the pure method \nsuch as template-based natural language generation or neural \nnatural language generation models. \n5.
