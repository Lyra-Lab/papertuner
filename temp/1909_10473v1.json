INTRODUCTION\nHydrocephalus is a rather broad term, which describes a\nrange of pathologies characterized by an excessive buildup of\nthe cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) in the CSF circulatory pathway\nof the brain [1]. The clinical picture is determined by the\ntype and stage of hydrocephalus. The speciﬁc signs, such as\nan increased head circumference, the fontanelle bulging, the\ndilated skull veins and the developmental delay, as compared\nto their contemporaries, are typical for the infants and are\nmost often associated with a congenital hydrocephalus. In the\nchildren aged 2 and over, the teenager and adult patients, the\nclinical signs are variable and non-speciﬁc. Normal pressure\nhydrocephalus diagnosed in the elderly patients (aged over\n65) presents in a classic triad of symptoms described by S.\nHakim and R. D. Adams in 1965, which include gait distur-\nbance, urinary incontinence and cognitive impairment [2]. The\nabove listed circumstances preclude making the diagnosis of\nhydrocephalus based on the clinical picture only.\nThe aggregated data on the occurrence of hydrocephalus\nsyndrome are available from the single cohort studies. Shya-\nmal C. Bir et al. indicate that the incidence of hydrocephalus\nin adults is as low as 17 case per 100,000 per year, which is\nsigniﬁcantly lower, than that in children (82 cases in 100,000\nnewborns) [3]. The infant hydrocephalus is one of the most\ncommon pathologies in the pediatric neurosurgery with its\nincidence varying from 68 cases per 100,000 newborns in the\nNorth America up to 145 and 316 cases per 100,000 newborns\nin the countries of Africa and Latin America, respectively [4].\nUsually, the epidemiological data on the individual nosological\nforms are available in the literature. Thus, the normal pressure\nhydrocephalus (NPH) occurs in 10-22 cases out of 100,000\nsubjects aged over 50 [5], [6]. According to the data from\ndifferent authors, NPH is observed in 6-10% of patients with\ndementia.\nThe secondary hydrocephalus, which in up to 62% of cases\naccompanies different brain neoplasms, may be due to a direct\nblock of CSF ﬂow (obstructive), as well as due to the CSF\noverproduction in response to the change of its chemical\ncontent, which occurs alongside with tumor progression. In\nposterior cranial fossa tumors of children, its occurrence\nranges from 70% to 90% [7]–[9]. In adult vestibular schwan-\nnomas, the occurrence of secondary hydrocephalus varies\nbetween 3,7% and 42% [10]. In adult brainstem gliomas, the\nheadache most often resulting from hydrocephalus, is the most\nfrequent early symptom [11]. Therefore, the hydrocephalus\ncan be either an independent disease, which is sometimes\ndifﬁcult to diagnose, or a concomitant symptom of a number\nof pathologies, therefore representing and urgent issue in the\npresent-day clinical practice.\nEven in case of ”evident” symptoms, the diagnosis of hydro-\ncephalus is made by MRI and CT neuroimaging approaches.\nWith the use of those methods, it is possible to discriminate be-\ntween the internal, external and mixed forms of hydrocephalus.\nThe information about the range of diagnostic criteria used\nto identify hydrocephalus using the MRI images has been\npublished. The identiﬁcation and analysis of those criteria\nrequire a considerable time and effort of qualiﬁed specialists in\ndiagnostic imaging. Performing screening tomography studies\nwill enable one to spot out the cases of deviations in the\narXiv:1909.10473v1  [cs.CV]  23 Sep 2019\nparameters of brain ventricular system, which, in turn, will\noffer an opportunity to suspect and diagnose the hydrocephalus\nat early stages and with minor clinical symptoms. Innovative\ntechnological approaches able to differentiate normal structure\nfrom the pathologies will be required in order to perform\nsuch studies, while also reducing the efforts of the overworked\nradiology specialists.\nMachine learning is currently actively used in the different\npractical ﬁelds and the areas of science. Machine learning\nis deﬁned as a set of methods able to automatically detect\nthe useful data patterns and to use the discovered patterns\nsubsequently to make predictions for the new data sets or to\ntake the decisions under uncertainty [12]. Since, a considerable\nprogress in computer vision has been achieved in 2012 due to\ndeep learning (an area of machine learning), the deep neural\nnetworks and, particularly, the convolutional neural networks\nhas become the main toll for the solving image detection,\nsegmentation and classiﬁcation problems [13]. Deep neural\nnetworks are especially useful for the analysis of extremely\nlarge data sets and, in most cases, neural networks quality\nimproved with increased size of the data. The applicability\nof these methods to the medical diagnostic procedures are\ncurrently under active investigation. The recently published\nresearch papers on the application of deep learning to different\nimaging diagnostic problems demonstrate promising results in\ndetection, segmentation and classiﬁcation tasks [14]–[18].\nDespite the demonstrated perfect results, the machine learn-\ning methods have particular limitations. A signiﬁcant im-\npediment to an active spread of this technology in medical\ndiagnostics is its dependence from the availability of large\nsets of high-quality prepared data, as well as the complexity\nof deep neural network interpretation. However, the problem\nof small data sets may be partially solved by the use of transfer\nlearning technique [19]. The concept behind it is involves\nan initial learning of a convolutional neural network using a\nlarge data set, which is not associated with the speciﬁc task\n(for example, a set of several millions of regular ImageNet\nphotos can be used for such learning) [20]. Further, this\nnetwork is ﬁne tuned to a speciﬁc problem, such as the tumor\nclassiﬁcation on medical images.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate deep learning appli-\ncability to the diagnostics of hydrocephalus with the use of\nMRI images. Employing the transfer learning technique, we\ndemonstrate promising results in training of deep neural nets\nwith small data sets.\nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS\nHere, we describe the most important steps of the performed\nresearch, namely:\n• Problem statement in terms of machine learning;\n• Methods of data collection, annotation, preprocessing and\nseparation;\n• Speciﬁc features of model training and the characteristics\nof software and hardware used.\nA. Problem statement.\nMaking the diagnosis of hydrocephalus using MRI images\nrepresents a problem of binary classiﬁcation. In this particular\ncase, we split the MRI scans into two groups, the ﬁrst one con-\ntains the images possessing the typical signs of hydrocephalus\n(classiﬁed as the pathology), while the second group represents\nthe images without such speciﬁc signs (and classiﬁed as the\nnormal structure). In the solution of such problems by machine\nlearning, the supervised machine learning approaches are used\nmost frequently. Such methods involve the available annota-\ntion, which presents the information about the class to which\na particular image belongs. The classiﬁer training involves\nmultiple passes of the training dataset through the machine\nlearning algorithm, following which the model quality is tested\non a set-aside dataset. In an ideal case, this process should\nyield a model capable of generalization, i.e., the one able\nto correctly classify the images, which has not been used in\ntraining. In our study, we are, thus, solving the problem of\nbinary classiﬁcation of the MRI images using the supervised\nmachine learning method.\nB. Data collection, annotation and preprocessing.\nData were collected retrospectively in a single medical\ncenter by the specialist in diagnostic imaging with a special\ntraining in MRI diagnostics and a 5-year work experience.\nAs much as 200 DICOM series of MRI brain images were\nselected. MRI scanning was performed with Toshiba instru-\nment (1.5 Tesla), the series selected for the analysis were\nrepresented by T2-weighed images. Further, the axial sections\nat the levels of lateral and the third ventricles were extracted\nfrom the stacks by a specialist, converted to JPEG format and\nused for further experiments.\nThe images were split into two groups: the normal group\ncontaining 100 image series of intact structures and the\npathology (hydrocephalus) group holding 100 image series\nof the pathologic structures. Since, from the clinical point of\nview, an internal hydrocephalus represents a more signiﬁcant\ncondition, as it poses a potential risk to the patient’s life, the\nimages classiﬁed as the pathologies had all satisﬁed the MRI\ncriteria for the internal hydrocephalus. The inclusion MRI\ncriteria were as follows: ventriculomegaly (Evans index >\n0.3), enlargement of the third ventricle (> 6 mm) and lateral\nventricles (> 18mm).\nOf note, the MRI images of children patients or those with a\nconcomitant brain pathology were excluded. Epidemiological\ncharacteristics of two cohorts were as follows: the normal\ngroup included 79 females and 21males, mean age - 33.8+-,\nwhile the pathology group included 64 females and 36 males,\nmean age 66.3+-. All MRI imaging procedures have been\nperformed over the period from November, 2016 to December,\n2018.\nImportantly, the image selection for the study was a two-\nstaged process. Originally, a group of subjects presenting with\nsigns of hydrocephalus, as concluded by a physician, was\nformed. Further a specialist in diagnostic imaging investigated\neach series of that group, and the images selected into “the\npathology” group were only those that demonstrated the above\nMRI criteria for hydrocephalus. By doing so, we achieved a\nhigh quality of dataset formation.\nFor the training and evaluation of generalization capability\nof a model, the sample is traditionally divided into training,\nvalidation, and testing sets. Such a division offers an oppor-\ntunity to train a model using training dataset, control model\nquality and ﬁne-tune different settings for model improvement\nusing validation dataset, and, ﬁnally, assess the model quality\nat the end of experiments using testing dataset containing only\nthe images, which have never been used for model training\nor ﬁne-tuning. However, sometimes such division cannot be\nfulﬁlled, for instance, due to a small size of training dataset.\nIn such a case, the method of cross-validation is employed\n[21]. In essence, the method is based on a random split of\nan entire sample into several groups, upon which training is\nconsistently performed using every group except one, which\nwill serve as a test set group. Then, the training step is repeated\nwith another group set aside and not used for training. One\ncan, thus, obtain a number of predictions equal to the number\nof groups, while the overall prediction of the model will be\ncalculated as the mean or median of all group predictions.\nIn our study, we used J-K-fold cross-validation [22]. This\nmethod is completely relevant to the above description, how-\never, instead of a single split into K groups, J random iterations\nof such split is used. Presumably, this approach can improve\nthe stability of prediction of an ensemble of models. We, thus,\nexpect to improve the accuracy, sensitivity, and speciﬁcity\nof the method. Noteworthy, medians and conﬁdence intervals\nwere calculated with the use of bootstrap statistical methods.\nC. Data preprocessing.\nAt the ﬁnal step preceding the model training, a random\naugmentation of images was performed. For the training set,\nthe following augmentations were applied with a probability\np = 0.75: image rotation within 10o angle, random crop\ncombined with zoom (up to 105%), lightning and contrast\nchange in the range of 10%. Only central crop was applied to\nvalidation and testing sets. The images were adjusted to the\nsame size (256x256 pixels) and normalized to the mean value\nand the standard deviation of ImageNet dataset.\nD. Model training.\nConsidering the successful application of transfer learning\nmethodology to different areas of computer vision, as ap-\nplied to regular and, sometimes, medical images, we use this\nmethodology in our work. We used the ResNet34 architecture\nmodel from the Fastai framework pre-trained models [23].\nThis architecture model proposed by He et al. can be used\nfor learning of the very deep neural networks with less\nparameters, while avoiding the risk of gradient vanishing. A\nmore detailed technical description of the model can be found\nin He et al [24]. The model was initiated according to the\nstandard parameters of Fastai software library, and training\nwas performed for the neural network classiﬁer (“head”) only,\nwhile the neural network “backbone” parameters were frozen.\nIn the classiﬁer, the dropout layers with probabilities of 0.5\n(for the last layer) and 0.25 (for the previous layers) were\nused in addition to the fully connected layers. We used the\nCategorical cross entropy loss function and Adam optimizer\nwith learning rate parameters of 0.001. The model training\nwas performed according to a one cycle policy implemented\nin the library [25].\nSince we used the cross-validation method in our work,\nthe training process itself is worth noting. j-k cross-validation\nwith j and k parameters of 5 was performed. Thus, the training\nprocess had 5 iterations with different random seed and splits\ninto 5 folds each. Insofar as we used the early stopping method\nand the choice of best model by the minimum value of the\nvalidation loss function for the statistics calculations, the use\nof validation dataset for the quality metrics calculation was not\npossible for the sake of preventing information leaks from this\ndataset. In order to solve this problem, the data were split into\n3 parts in each section. Training part was used for learning,\nthe validation part was intended for early stopping and the\nchoice of best model by the minimum validation loss value,\nwhile testing part was used for the calculation of model quality\nmetrics. Further, the general quality and conﬁdence intervals\nwere calculated from 25 obtained results using bootstrapping\nmethod.\nIn addition to model quality, the model interpretability is\nsigniﬁcant. We, therefore, investigate, which speciﬁc part of\nthe image is most important for the model learning. We use\nthe Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)\nmethod to this end [26]. In general, this method uses the\nactivation maps of the last convolution layer to visualize the\nareas responsible for the decision making about the class\nprediction and weighs them with the help of the predicted\nclass gradients.\nThe server equipped with Intel Core I7-7740X, 4.30GHz\nprocessor, two GeForce GTX 1080 video cards with 8 GB\nvideo memory and 32 GB RAM running on Linux (Ubuntu\n16.04.5 LTS) operating system. Python 3.7 programming lan-\nguage and Pytorch 1.0 and Fastai v1.0.39 frameworks were\nused for experiments.\nIII. RESULTS\nThe median, 2.5 percentile and 97.5 percentile values of\nthe system’s accuracy, sensitivity and speciﬁcity calculated\nwith the use of bootstrapping method were 97.5% (96.4 -\n98.2), 96.3% (94.8 - 97.7) and 98.1% (96.2 - 99.1), re-\nspectively. Noteworthy, we, practically, were not in search\nof the best hyperparameters for neural network, but rather\nused the early stopping method and the choice of best model\nby the minimum value of the validation loss function, as\nwell as the minimum set of image augmentations used to\nobtain a more diversiﬁed dataset. An important feature is\nthat the model predicts the class probabilities, not the class\nvalues (normal or pathological). Keeping in mind that the\nmedical diagnosis making requires better sensitivity in some\ncases, while better speciﬁcity in the others, and considering\nthe probability predictions, one will have an opportunity for\nFig. 1: Deep neural network interpretation with (a) activations maps\non the left, and (b) Grad-CAM on the right.\na more delicate ﬁne-tuning of the threshold used for class\nprediction, and, thus, the classiﬁer can be ﬁne-tuned for a\nspeciﬁc diagnostic task.\nFurthermore, we used Grad-CAM method for the model\nresult interpretation in our work. Figure 1 is demonstrating that\nthe most important information used by the model is contained\nin the images of the brain liquor system.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn our work, we collected a dataset of brain MRI images\nof the patients with or without the hydrocephalus. These data\nwere collected and annotated by the medical specialists, which\nensures the high annotation quality. Considering the small\ndataset size, our research was aiming to study the transfer\nlearning capacity to solve the problem of MRI image classiﬁ-\ncation into the normal and pathology groups. In our work, we\nused the convolution neural network of ResNet34 architecture,\nwhich was pre-learned using the ImageNet dataset images.\nAfter the ﬁne-tuning of this neural network with the use of\nbrain MRI image dataset, we obtained promising results. The\nfollowing indicators of the quality of model predictions was\nachieved, as 97.5% (96.4 - 98.2) for the accuracy, 96.3%\n(94.8 - 97.7) for the sensitivity, and 98.1% (96.2 - 99.1)\nfor the speciﬁcity. In this work, we ﬁrst demonstrated the\ncapacity of transfer learning method to make a diagnosis of\nthe hydrocephalus syndrome using the brain MRI images. In\nthis case, the high quality of a model is achieved while using\na rather limited training dataset.\nV. DISCUSSION\nSpeaking about the technical part of our work, a number of\nlimitations are worth paying attention. First, the small size of\nthe image dataset collected in a single clinic precludes us from\nconﬁdently extrapolating the achieved results to the overall\npopulation. However, the transfer learning technology and the\ncross-validation method enable us to make some preliminary\nconclusions.\nThe opinions about the large-scale screening neuroimaging\nstudies of the brain are contradictory. The authors indicate\nthat the economic beneﬁts are doubtful, while the number\nof incidental ﬁndings (IF) of conditions needing medical\ntreatment in the course of such screening brain studies in\nhealthy subjects are rather low [27]. Of note, the amount\nof such incidental ﬁndings has shown an increase over the\ndecade. In their research published in 2007, Meike W. Vernooij\net al.reported the frequency of such ﬁndings in a cohort of\n2000 healthy subjects aged 45,7 to 96,7 to be 7.2% [28]. In\n2017, Anna Brugulat-Serrat et al. reported that such conditions\nwere found in 27% among 575 healthy volunteers aged 45 to\n75 [29]. This fact is likely due to the use of MRI scanner\nwith different magnet ﬁeld strength, 1.5 Tesla in the ﬁrst\nresearch and 3.0 Tesla in the second one. Despite an increased\nnumber of incidental ﬁndings, the number of subjects, who\nneed treatment, remains rather low (0,1-0,3%). However, the\nMRI imaging was performed to the volunteers, who did not\nreport any health complaints, in these studies. We suggest\nto perform such screening tomography studies in the cohorts\nof patients with non-speciﬁc complaints, which can mask the\nparticular pathologies of the brain involving the development\nof hydrocephalus.\nSince such studies produce large massive of data, which\nrequire a mandatory interpretation by the experts, these ap-\nproaches have not become widespread, as yet. The practical in-\ntroduction of machine learning algorithms capable of recogniz-\ning different pathological patterns (and detecting the deviations\nfrom the normal structures) with little human assistance. We\nwere focused on the detection of internal hydrocephalus, when\nusing our dataset. As it was mentioned in the introduction,\nthe hydrocephalus is a rather widespread pathology in the\nneurological and neurosurgical practice, which can be either a\nseparate disease or to be of a secondary origin. In our opinion,\nthe approaches to an early veriﬁcation of hydrocephalus in the\npatients with non-speciﬁc health complaints are urgent in all\nage groups. In pediatric practice, this is relevant to the cases\nof brain tumors, since the latter are typically located along the\nmidline. Also, the plasticity of the brain and its capacity to a\nlong-term compensation are much higher in children, than in\nadults, which accounts for the delayed clinical symptoms, as\ncompared to the degree of pathological brain changes revealed\nby neurovisualization methods. In the middle-aged patients,\nthe MRI screening will help reveal different size deviations\nof ventricular system of both tumor and non-tumor origin. In\nthe elderly population, they will help detecting those subjects,\nwho represent a potential risk group for the development of\nnormotensive hydrocephalus.\nThe method of screening MRI studies supplemented with\nthe machine learning approaches will help reduce the labor\nburden to the radiologists and increase the availability of MRI\ndiagnostics for brain pathologies.\nVI.
