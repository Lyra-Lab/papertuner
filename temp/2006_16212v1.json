We use\na small corpus collected from different\nsources of text books, short stories and ar-\nticles of other topics. Based on the exper-\niments carried out, the morpheme identiﬁ-\ncation task using morphessor gives reason-\nable and interesting output despite using a\nsmall corpus.\n1\nIntroduction\nThe name Tangkhul (also known as Hao or Ihao\nespecially in older literature) refers to an ethnic\ngroup which live in the hill of Ukhrul district and\nKamjong district of Manipur State, India, and con-\ntiguous parts of Nagaland (another state of India)\nand Burma. The Tangkhuls are quite diversiﬁed\nlinguistically, and culturally.\nThe speech vari-\neties of most Tangkhul villages are not mutually\nintelligible with those of neighbouring villages.\nEven the similarities are large enough to facili-\ntate the rapid learning of one anothers languages.\nHowever, it is clear that the Tangkhul languages\nare closely related to one-another and form a dis-\ntinct subgroup within the Tibeto-Burman family.\nTangkhul is an ethnic group whose language varies\nfrom village to village. It has long been noted that\nTangkhul is a group of languages, rather than a\nsingle language (Brown 1837), however, almost\nall of the available descriptions of Tangkhul lan-\nguages have concentrated on a single varietythe\nlanguage of Ukhrul town, which has come to serve\nas a lingua franca for the whole Tangkhul tribe.\nEven if the Tangkhul language serve as a com-\nmon language for the whole Tangkhul region, but\nthe accent of speech (way of speaking Tangkhul)\nvaries from geographical area. Tangkhul region is\nmainly divided into four major part i.e. East (zing-\nsho), west (zingtun), North (ato), South (azay).\nThere are more than 100 language spoken in the\nvarious villages of Tangkhul diaspora, since all\nthe villages of Tangkhul region (Ukhrul district\n& Kamjong district) has their own native lan-\nguage, the pronunciation of the common language\n(Tangkhul) is highly varying.\nThe most obvious working deﬁnition of the\nTangkhul language is the family of Tibeto-Burman\nlanguages spoken by members of the Tangkhul\ntribe. This deﬁnition is complicated by a num-\nber of factors, and is clearly inadequate (as will\nbe seen), since some of the languages spoken as a\nmother-tongue by ethnic Tangkhuls are not mem-\nbers of the family being discussed here and be-\ncause it is possible that there are members of other\nNaga tribes speaking languages that belong in the\nTangkhul group.\nThus, while ethnicity can be\ntaken as neither a necessary nor a sufﬁcient cri-\nterion for membership in the Tangkhul family it is\nnevertheless a useful starting point for a discussion\nof this group of languages.\nMorphological processing of a language is the\nbeginning of NLP work of that particular lan-\nguage. There are reports on morphological pro-\ncessing work for many other major Indian lan-\nguages.\nBut, Tangkhul language in particular\nwhich falls under resource constrained and less\nprivileged category with no or little work on natu-\nral language processing till date. In this light, we\nattempt to collect small corpus and start the ini-\ntial steps towards morphological processing of this\nlanguage. The morphological analysis of this lan-\nguage is found to be slightly complex being agglu-\ntinative (Mortensen, 2003) one.\n2\nRelated Work\nThe\nTibeto-Burman\nlanguages\nof\nIndia\nare\nstill\nlacking\nthe\nbasic\nlanguage\nprocessing\ntools of required quality.\nAmong the re-\nported\nwork\non\nTibeto-Burman\nlanguages,\nBodo\n(Sarmah,\n2004),\nMizo\n(Pakray et al.,\n2015), Kok-borok (Debbarma et al., 2012) and\nManipuri (Singh and Bandyopadhyay, 2008) are\nmain. Almost all the reported work used apriori\nknowledge of the language either in the form of\ndictionary or in the form of preparing label data\nfor training. Being a resource less language, we\npreferred unsupervised learning approach for the\nconsidered language.\n2.1\nLanguage morphology and syntax\nTankhul has two distinct tones - high and low,\nmainly with the utterances associated with the let-\nter t, d, r, m, and f. For examples\n1. High (Kajuiya)\nChanhan Kasho (open) Khaikao (dry ﬁsh)\nKhalen (trap)\n2. Low (Khanema) kachang (month) kachui\n(high) mashit (closeness) ashee (blood)\nAdjective of Tangkhul displays a hybrid mor-\nphology, as it always occurs semantically some-\nwhere between verbs and nouns.\nLike other morphologically rich neighbour\nlanguages (Majumder et al., 2007; Saharia et al.,\n2014), Tangkhul also has a strong tendency to\nform sequence of afﬁxes to prepend/append to the\nroot.\nIn fact, many of the preﬁxes found in Tangkhul\nlanguage behaves morphologically as if they are\npart of the root.\nWhile it is possible to assign\nindependent historical origins to these elements,\nfrom a synchronic standpoint the factors that iden-\ntify them are phonological and not morphological.\nAs will be seen, it is often not possible to assign\na consistent meaning or grammatical function to\nthese preﬁxes, which will be referred to here as\nlexical preﬁxes (Mortensen, 2003).\n2.2\nWord Formation\nThe formation of words in a language is one the\ntopic, which still attracts the researchers most.\nThe two main class of word formation are inﬂec-\ntion and derivation.\nDerivation is divided into\nagain two classes - afﬁxation and compounding.\nCompounding is divided into three classes - en-\ndocentric compound, exocentric compound and\nco-ordinate compound.\nEndocentric compound\nis again divided into right headed compound and\nleft-headed compound. In the right-headed com-\npound, it may have many constituents such as\n‘noun + noun’ and ‘noun + derived noun’, but\n‘noun + noun’ is more used than the other one in\nTangkhul (Ahum, 1997).\nThere are three types of verb roots in Tangkhul-\nsimple, complex and compound. A simple root\nis irreducible ’core element’ obtained by drop-\nping all the afﬁxes.\nA root may be monosyl-\nlabic or bisyllabic. For example: lei (exist/have),\nvao (shout), and malai (forget). Though Tangkhul\nverbs are close class, few verbs are derived from\n’nominal’ roots. For example: /pha/ /ra/. Table 1\ntabulated few case markers of Tanghul language.\nThere are two broad types of modiﬁers- adjec-\ntival and adverbials. Adjectives, as a word class,\nare quite different from nouns and verbs. In the\ncase of Tangkhul language, the exact relationship\nbetween adjectives on the one hand, and other\ncategories like nouns, verbs and adverbs on the\nother, has been one of the disputed issues in lin-\nguistics. In Tangkhul language there is no distinc-\ntion between verbs and adjectives in the sense that\nthey are derived from roots, and function as adjec-\ntives or verbs with (a) appropriate afﬁxation and\n(b) appropriate occurrence in a sentence (Ahum,\n1997). Expressives (which are aplenty in the lan-\nguage and which most often have adverbial and\nadjectival functions) can be compounded with a\nnumber of roots to form compound adjectival. In\nthe process of compounding expressive tend to be-\nhave like intensiﬁers or modiﬁers. The following\nare some of the most commonly used adjectives\nformed by compounding roots and expressive.\n2.3\nCompounding and reduplication\nThere are some compound modiﬁers in the\nTangkhul, which are further reduplicated to denote\nmodiﬁed or completely changed meaning. In the\nprocess of reduplication, the last syllable of the\ncompound root is partially reduplicated by replac-\ning its initial consonant. The following are some\nof the most commonly used reduplicated com-\npound adjectives. For example: Root + Root +\nReduplicate\n• them-reak-sek = them (skill)- reak (pretend)-\nProceeding of Regional International Conference on Natural Language Processing (regICON) 2017, 3rd and 4th\nNovember 2017, IIIT Senapati, Manipur, India\nCase marker\nSufﬁx\nExample\nLocative case marker\n-li, -wui\nManipur-li (in Manipur)\nGenitive case marker\n-chi -\nAvi-chi (his)\nNominative case marker\n-na\nkhipa-na (who)\nTable 1: Few case markers with example\nsek (redu)\nApproximate English meaning: pretending to\nbe very skillful or learned\n• Khon-zar-tar = Khon (sound)- zar(dense)- tar\n(redu)\nApproximate English meaning: very noisy.\n3\nCorpus preparation and preprocessing\nAs the existence of the language is very rare in\nweb, we have manually collected/typed few texts\nfor our experiment.\nThe current version of the\ncorpus contains 21713 words, out of which 7362\nare unique words (include inﬂections). The arti-\ncles or segment of articles in the corpus can be\ncategoried into biography (4 numbers), short story\n(6 numbers), essay (11 numbers), drama (2 num-\nbers) and letter (1 number) with average (approx-\nimately) 904 words per article.

This leaning\napproach discovers the primitive morphological\nunits such as root/base/stem2, sufﬁx and preﬁx\n1http://www.http://morpho.aalto.ﬁ/projects/morpho; Ac-\ncess date: 30 August, 2017.\n2Though, there are differences in the concept of root, base\nof the utterances of a language. As it is based on\nwords or utterance of the language and its fre-\nquency, most of the time, the tool discovers preﬁx\n(in sequence), stem and sufﬁx (in sequence).\nDuring experiment, we found that, a word may\nhave maximum seven different morpheme, mostly\nsequence of afﬁxes.\nThe morpheme frequency\nwith example is tabulated in Table 3.\nWe also\nfound that The corpus contains a good number of\nborrowed words from English and neighbouring\nlanguages.\nThe following examples shows the morphologi-\ncal richness of the considered language segmented\nusing Morfessor.\nmaphaning (not thinking) = ma (no) + phaning\n(thinking)\nmaphaninsali = ma + pha + nin + sa + li\nmap˜amsangmara = ma + p˜a + m + sa + ng + mara\nkhamashash˜ali = kha + ma + sha + sh + ˜ali\nkakhararkhangazai = ka + kharar + kha + nga +\nzai\n˜ach˜ahonthangcham = ˜a + ch˜a + hon + thang +\ncham\nThe following are few examples, the Morfessor\nsegmented correctly.\na + cham + ˜aram\n˜a + lung + th + ung + li\n˜a + ng + ˜a + ng + nao + li\na + ri + shang + li\nTable 4 tabulated few words incorrectly segmented\nby Morfessor.\nInterestingly, during segmentation, based on the\nevidence in the corpus, the tool is splitting the\nfollowing English words used as loan words in\nTangkhul (Table 5).\nIn the context of loan words, another interesting\nexample we found is acid + p˜a + va. Though the\nroot (the ﬁrst morpheme) is a valid loan word, the\ncontext actually was indicating the root aship˜ava\n(means wife).\nand stem, for this experiment we are using these terms inter-\nchangeably to indicate stem\nProceeding of Regional International Conference on Natural Language Processing (regICON) 2017, 3rd and 4th\nNovember 2017, IIIT Senapati, Manipur, India\nWords with no afﬁx\n1772\nExample: khana\nWords with one afﬁx\n3600\nExample: advocate+la\nWords with two afﬁxes\n1487\nExample: ˜a+thingreira+wui\nWords with three afﬁxes\n410\nExample: kajui+kha+nem\nWords with four afﬁxes\n78\nExample: +lung+th+ung+li\nWords with ﬁve afﬁxes\n12\nExample: la+ng+da+ng+l˜a+na\nWords with Six afﬁxes\n3\nExample: kha+nga+p+eo+bing+li+la\nTable 3: Afﬁx frequency distribution in the corpus\nWrong (By Morfessor)\nCorrect\n˜a + k˜a + khare + wui\n˜a + k˜a + kha + re + wui\n˜a + mathen + pai + ra\n˜a + ma + then + pai + ra\n˜a + ngas˜am + khuiya\n˜a + nga + s˜am + khui + ya\nTable 4: Incorrect segmentation of words\nacqui + red\nWrong\nactiv + ities\nWrong\nactiv + ity\nWrong\nadministra + tion + wui\nWrong\nTable 5: Segmentation of loan words\n4\nConclusion\nThe demand for localization through electronic\ncontent has made the globe a smaller place and\nany digital divide in this regard has to be reduced\nthrough the inclusion of more naturally occur-\nring languages through the information technol-\nogy revolution. Towards this direction, the present\ntask is a step to bring Tangkhul into the language\ntechnology revolution.\nIn the present work, we\nreported the morphological processing work of\nTangkhul using an unsupervised approach.\nWe\nfound the result of the experiment to be reasonably\ngood as compared to the size of the corpus used\nin the work. Our future direction includes more\nexperiment on this by including language speciﬁc\nrules and other semi-supervised approaches.\nReferences\nVictor Ahum. 1997.\nTangkhul-Naga Grammar: A\nStudy of Word Formation.
