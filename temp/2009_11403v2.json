Recent high-profile\napplications of reinforcement learning include beating the world’s best players at Go [SHM+16], competing against\ntop professionals in Dota [Ope18], improving protein structure prediction [SEJ+20], and automatically controlling\ncomplex robots [GHLL16]. These successes motivate the use of reinforcement learning in safety-critical and\ncorrectness-critical settings.\nReinforcement learning algorithms produce, at a minimum, a policy that specifies which action(s) should be\ntaken in a given state. The primary correctness property for reinforcement learning algorithms is convergence:\nin the limit, a reinforcement learning algorithm should converge to a policy that optimizes for the expected\nfuture-discounted value of the reward signal.\nThis paper contributes CertRL, a formal proof of convergence for value iteration and policy iteration two canon-\nical reinforcement learning algorithms [Bel54, How60, Put94]. They are often taught as the first reinforcement\nlearning methods in machine learning courses because the algorithms are relatively simple but their convergence\nproofs contain the main ingredients of a typical convergence argument for a reinforcement learning algorithm.\nThere is a cornucopia of presentations of these iterative algorithms and an equally diverse variety of proof\ntechniques for establishing convergence. Many presentations state but do not prove the fact that the optimal\npolicy of an infinite-horizon Markov decision process with 𝛾-discounted reward is a stationary policy; i.e., the\noptimal decision in a given state does not depend on the time step at which the state is encountered. Following\nthis convention, this paper contributes the first formal proof that policy and value iteration converge in the\nlimit to the optimal policy in the space of stationary policies for infinite-horizon Markov decision processes. In\naddition to establishing convergence results for the classical iterative algorithms under classical infinitary and\narXiv:2009.11403v2  [cs.AI]  15 Dec 2020\nVajjha et al.\nstationarity assumptions, we also formalize an optimality result about 𝑛-step iterations of value iteration without\na stationarity assumption. The former formalization matches the standard theoretical treatment, while the latter\nis closer to real-world implementations. We shall refer to the former case – where the set of time steps is an\ninfinite set – as infinite-horizon and the latter case as finite-horizon.\nIn all cases, the convergence argument for policy/value iteration proceeds by proving that a contractive\nmapping converges to a fixed point and that this fixed point is an optimum. This is typical of convergence proofs\nfor reinforcement learning algorithms. CertRL is intentionally designed for ongoing reinforcement learning\nformalization efforts.\nFormalizing the convergence proof directly would require complicated and tedious 𝜖-hacking as well as\nlong proofs involving large matrices. CertRL obviates these challenges using a combination of the Giry monad\n[Gir82, Jac18] and a proof technique called Metric coinduction [Koz07].\nMetric coinduction was first identified by Kozen and Ruozzi as a way to streamline and simplify proofs of\ntheorems about streams and stochastic processes [KR09]. Our convergence proofs use a specialized version of\nmetric coinduction called contraction coinduction [FHM18] to reason about order statements concerning fixed\npoints of contractive maps. Identifying a coinduction hypothesis allows us to automatically infer that a given\n(closed) property holds in the limit whenever it holds ab initio. The coinduction hypothesis guarantees that this\nproperty is a limiting invariant. This is significant because the low level 𝜖−𝛿arguments – typically needed\nto show that a given property holds of the limit – are now neatly subsumed by a single proof rule, allowing\nreasoning at a higher level of abstraction.\nThe finitary Giry monad is a monad structure on the space of all finitely supported probability mass functions\non a set. Function composition in the Kleisli category of this monad recovers the Chapman-Kolmogorov formula\n[Per19, Jac18]. Using this fact, our formalization recasts iteration of a stochastic matrix in a Markov decision\nprocess as iterated Kleisli composites of the Giry monad, starting at an initial state. Again, this makes the\npresentation cleaner since we identify and reason about the basic operations of bind and ret, thus bypassing the\nneed to define matrices and matrix multiplication and substantially simplifying convergence proofs.\nThis paper shows how these two basic building blocks – the finitary Giry monad and metric coinduction\n– provide a compelling foundation for formalizing reinforcement learning theory. CertRL develops the basic\nconcepts in reinforcement learning theory and demonstrates the usefulness of this library by proving several\nresults about value and policy iteration. CertRL contains a proof of the Bellman optimality principle, an inductive\nrelation on the optimal value and policy over the horizon length of the Markov decision process.\nIn practice, reinforcement learning algorithms almost always run in finite time by either fixing a run time\ncutoff (e.g., number training steps) or by stopping iteration after the value/policy changes become smaller than a\nfixed threshold. Therefore, our development also formalizes a proof that 𝑛-step value iteration satisfies a finite\ntime analogue of our convergence results.\nTo summarize, the CertRL library contains:\n(1) a formalization of Markov decision processes and their long-term values in terms of the finitary Giry\nmonad,\n(2) a formalization of optimal value functions and the Bellman operator,\n(3) a formal proof of convergence for value iteration and a formalization of the policy improvement theorem\nin the case of stationary policies, and\n(4) a formal proof that the optimal value function for finitary sequences satisfies the finite time analogue of\nthe Bellman equation.\nCertRL: Formalizing Convergence Proofs for Value and Policy Iteration in Coq\nThroughout the text which follows, hyperlinks to theorems, definitions and lemmas which have formal\nequivalents in the Coq [Tea04] development are indicated by a ✿.1\nCertRL is part of a larger project for verifying machine learning theory with applications to program synthesis.\nThe entire development is available online at the following URL: https://github.com/IBM/FormalML.\n2\nBACKGROUND\nWe provide a brief introduction to value/policy iteration and to the mathematical structures upon which our\nformalization is built: contractive metric spaces, metric coinduction, the Giry monad and Kleisli composition.\n2.1\nReinforcement Learning\nThis section gently introduces the basics of reinforcement learning with complete information about the stochastic\nreward and transition functions. In this simplified situation the focus of the algorithm is on optimal exploitation\nof reward. This framework is also known as the stochastic optimal control problem.\nWe give an informal definition of Markov decision processes, trajectories, long-term values, and dynamic\nprogramming algorithms for solving Markov decision processes. Many of these concepts will be stated later in a\nmore formal type-theoretic style; here, we focus on providing an intuitive introduction to the field.\nThe basic mathematical object in reinforcement learning theory is the Markov decision process. A Markov\ndecision process is a 4-tuple (𝑆,𝐴, 𝑅,𝑇) where 𝑆is a set of states, 𝐴is a set of actions, 𝑅: 𝑆× 𝐴× 𝑆→R is a\nreward function, and 𝑇is a transition relation on states and actions mapping each (𝑠,𝑎,𝑠′) ∈𝑆× 𝐴× 𝑆to the\nprobability that taking action 𝑎in state 𝑠results in a transition to 𝑠′. Markov decision processes are so-called\nbecause they characterize a sequential decision-making process (each action is a decision) in which the transition\nstructure on states and actions depends only on the current state.\nExample 1 (CeRtL the turtle ✿). Consider a simple grid world environment in which a turtle can move in\ncardinal directions throughout a 2D grid. The turtle receives +1 point for collecting stars, -10 for visiting red\nsquares, and +2 for arriving at the green square. The turtle chooses which direction to move, but with probability\n1\n4 will move in the opposite direction. For example, if the turtle takes action left then it will go left with\nprobability 3\n4 and right with probability 1\n4. The game ends when the turtle arrives at the green square.\nThis environment is formulated as a Markov decision process as follows:\n• The set of states 𝑆are the coordinates of each box ✿:\n{(𝑥,𝑦) | 1 ≤𝑥≤5 and 1 ≤𝑦≤5}\nso that (1, 1) is the top-left corner and (5, 5) is the bottom-right corner.\n• The set of actions 𝐴are {up, down, left, right} ✿.\n1We recommend MacOS users view this document in Adobe, Firefox, or Chrome, as Preview and Safari parse the URLs linked to by ✿’s\nincorrectly.\nVajjha et al.\nFig. 1. An example grid-world environment ✿.\n• The reward function is defined as ✿:\n𝑅(1, 4) = 2\n𝑅(4, 2) = 1\n𝑅(3, 3) = 1\n𝑅({1, 2, 3}, 2) = −10\n𝑅(4, 3) = −10\n𝑅(2, 4) = −10\n𝑅(4, 5) = −10\n𝑅(·, ·) = 0 otherwise\n• The transition probabilities are as described ✿; e.g.,\n𝑇((3, 4), up, (3, 3)) = 3\n4\n𝑇((3, 4), up, (3, 5)) = 1\n4\n𝑇((3, 4), up, (·, ·)) = 0 otherwise\nand so on.\nWe implement this example in Coq as a proof-of-concept for CertRL. We first define a matrix whose indices are\nstates (𝑥,𝑦) and whose entries are colors {red, green, star, empty}. We then define a reward function that maps\nfrom matrix entries to a reward depending on the color of the turtle’s current state. We also define a transition\nfunction that comports with the description given above. At last, we prove that this combination of states, actions,\ntransitions and rewards inhabits our MDP (standing for Markov decision process) type. Therefore, all of the theorems\ndeveloped in this paper apply directly to our Coq implementation of the CertRL Turtle environment.\nCertRL: Formalizing Convergence Proofs for Value and Policy Iteration in Coq\nThe goal of reinforcement learning is to find a policy (𝜋: 𝑆→𝐴) specifying which action the algorithm should\ntake in each state. This policy should maximize the amount of reward obtained by the agent. A policy is stationary\nif it is not a function of time; i.e., if the optimal action in some state 𝑠∈𝑆is always the same and, in particular,\nindependent of the specific time step at which 𝑠is encountered.\nReinforcement learning agents optimize for a discounted sum of rewards – placing more emphasis on reward\nobtained today and less emphasis on reward obtained tomorrow. A constant discount factor from the open unit\ninterval, typically denoted by 𝛾, quantitatively discounts future rewards and serves as a crucial hyperparameter\nto reinforcement learning algorithms.\nValue iteration, invented by Bellman [Bel54], is a dynamic programming algorithm that finds optimal policies\nto reinforcement learning algorithms by iterating a contractive mapping. Value iteration is defined in terms of a\nvalue function 𝑉𝜋: 𝑆→R, where 𝑉𝜋(𝑠) is the expected value of state 𝑠when following policy 𝜋from 𝑠.\nData:\nMarkov decision process (𝑆,𝐴,𝑇, 𝑅)\nInitial value function 𝑉0 = 0\nThreshold 𝜃> 0\nDiscount factor 0 < 𝛾< 1\nResult: 𝑉∗, the value function for an optimal policy.\nfor 𝑛from 0 to ∞do\nfor each 𝑠∈𝑆do\n𝑉𝑛+1[𝑠] = max𝑎\nÍ\n𝑠′ 𝑇(𝑠,𝑎,𝑠′)(𝑅(𝑠,𝑎,𝑠′) + 𝛾𝑉𝑛[𝑠′])\nend\nif ∀𝑠|𝑉𝑛+1[𝑠] −𝑉𝑛| < 𝜃then\nreturn 𝑉𝑛+1\nend\nend\nAlgorithm 1: Pseudocode for Value Iteration.\nThe optimal policy 𝜋∗is then obtained by\n𝜋∗(𝑎) = argmax𝑎∈𝐴\n∑︁\n𝑠′\n𝑇(𝑠,𝑎,𝑠′)(𝑅(𝑠,𝑎,𝑠′) + 𝛾𝑉𝑛+1[𝑠′]).\nPolicy iteration follows a similar iteration scheme, but with a policy estimation function 𝑄𝜋: 𝑆× 𝐴→R\nwhere 𝑄𝜋(𝑠,𝑎) estimates the value of taking action 𝑎in state 𝑠and then following the policy 𝜋. In Section 3.4\nwe will demonstrate a formalized proof that 𝑉𝑛is the optimal value function of a length 𝑛MDP; this algorithm\nimplements the dynamic programming principle.\n2.2\nMetric and Contraction Coinduction\nOur formalization uses metric coinduction to establish convergence properties for infinite sequences. This section\nrecalls the Banach fixed point theorem and explains how this theorem gives rise to a useful proof technique.\nA metric space (𝑋,𝑑) is a set 𝑋equipped with a function 𝑑: 𝑋× 𝑋→R satisfying certain axioms that ensure\n𝑑behaves like a measurement of the distance between points in 𝑋. A metric space is complete if the limit of every\nCauchy sequence of elements in 𝑋is also in 𝑋.\nLet (𝑋,𝑑) denote a complete metric space with metric 𝑑. Subsets of 𝑋are modeled by terms of the function\ntype 𝜙: 𝑋→Prop. Another interpretation is that 𝜙denotes all those terms of 𝑋which satisfy a particular\nproperty. These subsets are also called Ensembles in the Coq standard library.\nVajjha et al.\nA Lipschitz map ✿is a mapping that is Lipschitz continuous; i.e., a mapping 𝐹from (𝑋,𝑑𝑋) into (𝑌,𝑑𝑌) such\nthat for all 𝑥1,𝑥2 ∈𝑋there is some 𝐾≥0 such that\n𝑑𝑌(𝐹(𝑥1), 𝐹(𝑥2)) ≤𝐾𝑑𝑋(𝑥1,𝑥2).\nThe constant 𝐾is called a Lipschitz constant.\nA map 𝐹: 𝑋→𝑋is called a contractive map ✿, or simply a contraction, if there exists a constant 0 ≤𝛾< 1\nsuch that\n𝑑(𝐹(𝑢), 𝐹(𝑣)) ≤𝛾𝑑(𝑢, 𝑣)\n∀𝑢, 𝑣∈𝑋.\nContractive maps are Lipschitz maps with Lipschitz constant 𝛾< 1.\nThe Banach fixed point theorem is a standard result of classical analysis which states that contractive maps on\ncomplete metric spaces have a unique fixed point.\nTheorem 2 (Banach fixed point theorem). If (𝑋,𝑑) is a nonempty complete metric space and 𝐹: 𝑋→𝑋is a\ncontraction, then 𝐹has a unique fixed point; i.e., there exists a point 𝑥∗∈𝑋such that 𝐹(𝑥∗) = 𝑥∗. This fixed point is\n𝑥∗= lim𝑛→∞𝐹(𝑛) (𝑥0) where 𝐹(𝑛) stands for the 𝑛-th iterate of the function 𝐹and 𝑥0 is an arbitrary point in 𝑋.\nThe Banach fixed point theorem generalizes to subsets of 𝑋.\nTheorem 3 (Banach fixed point theorem on subsets ✿). Let (𝑋,𝑑) be a complete metric space and 𝜙a\nclosed nonempty subset of 𝑋. Let 𝐹: 𝑋→𝑋be a contraction and assume that 𝐹preserves 𝜙. In other words,\n𝜙(𝑢) →𝜙(𝐹(𝑢))\nThen 𝐹has a unique fixed point in 𝜙; i.e., a point 𝑥∗∈𝑋such that 𝜙(𝑥∗) and 𝐹(𝑥∗) = 𝑥∗. The fixed point of 𝐹is\ngiven by 𝑥∗= lim𝑛→∞𝐹(𝑛) (𝑥0) where 𝐹(𝑛) stands for the 𝑛-th iterate of the function 𝐹.\nBoth the Banach fixed point theorem and the more general theorem on subsets were previously formalized\nin Coq by Boldo et al. [BCF+17]. This formalization includes definitions of Lipschitz maps and contractions.\nWe make use of the fact that Boldo et al. prove the above theorem where 𝑋is either a CompleteSpace or a\nCompleteNormedModule.\nThe fixed point of 𝐹in Theorem 3 is unique, but it depends on an initial point 𝑥0 ∈𝑋, which 𝐹then iterates on.\nUniqueness of the fixed point implies that different choices of the initial point still give the same fixed point ✿.\nTo emphasize how this theorem is used in our formalization, we restate it as an inductive proof rule:\n𝜙closed\n∃𝑥0,𝜙(𝑥0)\n𝜙(𝑢) →𝜙(𝐹(𝑢))\n𝜙(fix 𝐹𝑥0)\n✿\n(1)\nThis proof rule states that in order to prove some closed 𝜙is a property of a fixed point of 𝐹, it suffices to\nestablish the standard inductive assumptions: that 𝜙holds for some initial 𝑥0, and that if 𝜙holds at 𝑢then it also\nholds after a single application of 𝐹to 𝑢. In this form, the Banach fixed point theorem is called Metric coinduction.\nThe rule (1) is coinductive because it is equivalent to the assertion that a certain coalgebra is final in a category of\ncoalgebras. (Details are given in Section 2.3 of Kozen and Ruozzi [KR09]).\nThe following snippet shows how we use the Banach Fixed Point theorem as proven in [BCF+17] as a proof\nrule.\nTheorem metric_coinduction {phi : X →Prop}\n( nephi : phi init) ( Hcphi : closed phi)\n( HFphi : forall x : X, phi x →phi (F x)):\nphi ( fixpt F init).\nProof.\nassert (my_complete phi)\nCertRL: Formalizing Convergence Proofs for Value and Policy Iteration in Coq\nby ( now apply closed_my_complete).\ndestruct (FixedPoint K F phi fphi ( ex_intro _ _ init_phi)\nH hF) as [? [Hin [? [? Hsub]]]].\nspecialize (Hsub init init_phi).\nrewrite ←Hsub in Hin.\napply Hin.\nQed.\nDefinition 4 (Ordered Metric Space). A metric space 𝑋is called an ordered metric space if the underlying set 𝑋\nis partially ordered and the sets {𝑧∈𝑋|𝑧≤𝑦} and {𝑧∈𝑋|𝑦≤𝑧} are closed sets in the metric topology for every\n𝑦∈𝑋.\nFor ordered metric spaces, metric coinduction specializes to [FHM18, Theorem 1], which we restate as Theorem 5\nbelow.\nTheorem 5 (Contraction coinduction). Let 𝑋be a non-empty, complete ordered metric space. If 𝐹: 𝑋→𝑋\nis a contraction and is order-preserving, then:\n• ∀𝑥, 𝐹(𝑥) ≤𝑥⇒𝑥∗≤𝑥✿and\n• ∀𝑥,𝑥≤𝐹(𝑥) ⇒𝑥≤𝑥∗✿\nwhere 𝑥∗is the fixed point of 𝐹.\nWe will use the above result to reason about Markov decision processes. However, doing so requires first\nsetting up an ordered metric space on the function space 𝐴→R where 𝐴is a finite set ✿.\n2.3\nThe function space 𝐴→R.\nLet 𝐴be a finite set ✿. We endow the function space 𝐴→R with a natural vector space structure and with 𝐿∞\nnorm ✿:\n∥𝑓∥∞= max\n𝑎∈𝐴|𝑓(𝑎)|\n(2)\nOur development establishes several important properties about this function space. The norm (2) is well-\ndefined because 𝐴is finite and furthermore induces a metric that makes 𝐴→R a metric space ✿. With this\nmetric, the space of functions 𝐴→R is also complete ✿. From R this metric inherits a pointwise order; viz., for\nfunctions 𝑓,𝑔: 𝐴→R,\n𝑓≤𝑔\n⇐⇒∀𝑎∈𝐴, 𝑓(𝑎) ≤𝑔(𝑎) ✿\n𝑓≥𝑔\n⇐⇒∀𝑎∈𝐴, 𝑓(𝑎) ≥𝑔(𝑎) ✿\nWe also prove that the sets\n{𝑓|𝑓≤𝑔} ✿\nand\n{𝑓|𝑓≥𝑔} ✿\nare closed in the norm topology. Our formalization of the proof of closedness for these sets relies on classical\nreasoning. Additionally, we rely on functional extensionality to reason about equality between functions.\nWe now have an ordered metric space structure on the function space 𝐴→R when 𝐴is finite. Constructing a\ncontraction on this space will allow an application of Theorem 5. Once we set up a theory of Markov decision\nprocesses we will have natural examples of such a function space and contractions on it. Before doing so, we first\nintroduce the Giry monad.\nVajjha et al.\n2.4\n(Finitary) Giry Monad\nA monad structure on the category of all measurable spaces was first described by Lawvere in [Law62] and was\nexplicitly defined by Giry in [Gir82]. This monad has since been called the Giry monad. While the construction is\nvery general (applying to arbitrary measures on a space), for our purposes it suffices to consider finitely supported\nprobability measures.\nThe Giry monad for finitely supported probability measures is called the finitary Giry monad, although\nsometimes also goes by the more descriptive names distribution monad and convex combination monad.\nOn a set 𝐴, let 𝑃(𝐴) denote the set of all finitely-supported probability measures on 𝐴✿. An element of 𝑃(𝐴)\nis a list of elements of 𝐴together with probabilities. The probability assigned to an element 𝑎: 𝐴is denoted by\n𝑝(𝑎).\nIn our development we state this as the record\nRecord Pmf (A : Type) := mkPmf {\noutcomes :> list ( nonnegreal ∗A);\nsum1 : list_fst_sum outcomes = R1\n}.\nwhere outcomes stores all the entries of the type A along with their atomic probabilities. The field sum1 ensures\nthat the probabilities sum to 1.\nThe Giry monad is defined in terms of two basic operations associated to this space:\nret : 𝐴→𝑃(𝐴) ✿\n𝑎↦→𝜆𝑥: 𝐴, 𝛿𝑎(𝑥)\nwhere 𝛿𝑎(𝑥) = 1 if 𝑎= 𝑥and 0 otherwise. The other basic operation is\nbind : 𝑃(𝐴) →(𝐴→𝑃(𝐵)) →𝑃(𝐵) ✿\nbind 𝑝𝑓= 𝜆𝑏: 𝐵,\n∑︁\n𝑎∈𝐴\n𝑓(𝑎)(𝑏) ∗𝑝(𝑎)\nIn both cases the resulting output is a probability measure. The above definition is well-defined because we\nonly consider finitely-supported probability measures. A more general case is obtained by replacing sums with\nintegrals.\nThe definitions of bind and ret satisfy the following properties:\nbind (ret 𝑥) 𝑓= ret(𝑓(𝑥)) ✿\n(3)\nbind 𝑝(𝜆𝑥, 𝛿𝑥) = 𝑝✿\n(4)\nbind (bind 𝑝𝑓) 𝑔= bind 𝑝(𝜆𝑥, bind (𝑓𝑥) 𝑔) ✿\n(5)\nThese monad laws establish that the triple (𝑃, bind, ret) forms a monad.\nThe Giry monad has been extensively studied and used by various authors because it has several attractive\nqualities that simplify (especially formal) proofs. First, the Giry monad naturally admits a denotational monadic\nsemantics for certain probabilistic programs [RP02, JP89, ŚGG15, APM09]. Second, it is useful for rigorously\nformalizing certain informal arguments in probability theory by providing a means to perform ad hoc notation\noverloading [TTV19]. Third, it can simplify certain constructions such as that of the product measure [EHN15].\nCertRL uses the Giry monad as a substitute for the stochastic matrix associated to a Markov decision process.\nThis is possible because the Kleisli composition of the Giry monad recovers the Chapman-Kolmogorov formula\n[Per18, Per19]. The Kleisli composition is the fish operator in Haskell parlance.\nCertRL: Formalizing Convergence Proofs for Value and Policy Iteration in Coq\n2.4.1\nKleisli Composition. Reasoning about probabilistic processes requires composing probabilities. The Chapman-\nKolmogorov formula is a classical result in the theory of Markovian processes that states the probability of\ntransition from one state to another through two steps can be obtained by summing up the probability of visiting\neach intermediate state. This application of the Chapman-Kolmogorov formula plays a fundamental role in the\nstudy of Markovian processes, but requires formalizing and reasoning about matrix operations.\nKleisli composition provides an alternative and more elegant mechanism for reasoning about compositions of\nprobabilistic choices. This section defines and provides an intuition for Kleisli composition.\nThink of 𝑃(𝐴) as the random elements of 𝐴([Per18, page 15]). In this paradigm, the set of maps 𝐴→𝑃(𝐵) are\nsimply the set of maps with a random outcome. When 𝑃is a monad, such maps are called Kleisli arrows of 𝑃.\nIn terms of reinforcement learning, a map 𝑓: 𝐴→𝑃(𝐵) is a rule which takes a state 𝑎: 𝐴and gives the\nprobability of transitioning to state 𝑏: 𝐵. Suppose now that we have another such rule 𝑔: 𝐵→𝑃(𝐶). Kleisli\ncomposition puts 𝑓and 𝑔together to give a map (𝑓\n𝑔) : 𝐴→𝑃(𝐶). It is defined as:\n𝑓\n𝑔:= 𝜆𝑥: 𝐴, bind (𝑓𝑥) 𝑔\n(6)\n= 𝜆𝑥: 𝐴, (𝜆𝑐: 𝐶,\n∑︁\n𝑏:𝐵\n𝑔(𝑏)(𝑐) ∗𝑓(𝑥)(𝑏))\n(7)\n= 𝜆(𝑥: 𝐴) (𝑐: 𝐶),\n∑︁\n𝑏:𝐵\n𝑓(𝑥)(𝑏) ∗𝑔(𝑏)(𝑐)\n(8)\nThe motivation for (6)–(8) is intuitive. In order to start at 𝑥: 𝐴and end up at 𝑐: 𝐶by following the rules 𝑓\nand 𝑔, one must first pass through an intermediate state 𝑏: 𝐵in the codomain of 𝑓and the domain of 𝑔. The\nprobability of that point being any particular 𝑏: 𝐵is\n𝑓(𝑥)(𝑏) ∗𝑔(𝑏)(𝑐).\nSo, to obtain the total probability of transitioning from 𝑥to 𝑐, simply sum over all intermediate states 𝑏: 𝐵. This\nis exactly (8). We thus recover the classical Chapman-Kolmogorov formula, but as a Kleisli composition of the\nGiry monad. This obviates the need for reasoning about operators on linear vector spaces, thereby substantially\nsimplifying the formalization effort.\nIndeed, if we did not use Kleisli composition, we would have to associate a stochastic transition matrix to our\nMarkov process and manually prove various properties about stochastic matrices which can quickly get tedious.\nWith Kleisli composition however, our proofs become more natural and we reason closer to the metal instead of\nadapting to a particular representation.\n3\nTHE CERTRL LIBRARY\nCertRL contains a formalization of Markov decision processes, a definition of the Kleisli composition specialized\nto Markov decision processes, a definition of the long-term value of a Markov decision process, a definition of\nthe Bellman operator, and a formalization of the operator’s main properties.\nBuilding on top of its library of results about Markov decision processes, CertRL contains proofs of our main\nresults:\n(1) the (infinite) sequence of value functions obtained by value iteration converges in the limit to a global\noptimum assuming stationary policies,\n(2) the (infinite) sequence of policies obtained by policy iteration converges in the limit to a global optimum\nassuming stationary policies, and\n(3) the optimal value function for Markov decision process of length 𝑛is computed inductively by application\nof Bellman operator, Section 3.4.\nThe following sections describe the above results more carefully.\nVajjha et al.\n3.1\nMarkov Decision Processes\nWe refer to [Put94] for detailed presentation of the theory of Markov decision processes. Our formalization\nconsiders the theory of infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision processes with deterministic stationary policies.\nWe now elaborate on the above definitions and set up relevant notation. Our presentation will be type-theoretic\nin nature, to reflect the formal development. The exposition (and CertRL formalization) closely follows the work\nof Frank Feys, Helle Hvid Hansen, and Lawrence Moss [FHM18].\n3.1.1\nBasic Definitions.\nDefinition 6 (Markov Decision Process ✿). A Markov decision process consists of the following data:\n• A nonempty finite type 𝑆called the set of states.2\n• For each state 𝑠: 𝑆, a nonempty finite type 𝐴(𝑠) called the type of actions available at state 𝑠. This is modelled\nas a dependent type.\n• A stochastic transition structure 𝑇: Î\n𝑠:𝑆(𝐴(𝑠) →𝑃(𝑆)). Here 𝑃(𝑆) stands for the set of all probability\nmeasures on 𝑆, as described in Section 2.4.\n• A reward function 𝑟: Î\n𝑠:𝑆(𝐴(𝑠) →𝑆→R) where 𝑟(𝑠,𝑎,𝑠′) is the reward obtained on transition from state 𝑠\nto state 𝑠′ under action 𝑎.\nFrom these definitions it follows that the rewards are bounded in absolute value: since the state and action\nspaces are finite, there exists a constant 𝐷such that\n∀(𝑠𝑠′ : 𝑆), (𝑎: 𝐴(𝑠)), |𝑟(𝑠,𝑎,𝑠′)| ≤𝐷✿\n(9)\nDefinition 7 (Decision Rule / Policy). Given a Markov decision process with state space 𝑆and action space\nÎ\n𝑠:𝑆𝐴(𝑠),\n• A function 𝜋: Î\n𝑠:𝑆𝐴(𝑠) is called a decision rule ✿. The decision rule is deterministic 3.\n• A stationary policy is an infinite sequence of decision rules: (𝜋, 𝜋, 𝜋, ...) ✿. Stationary implies that the same\ndecision rule is applies at each step.\nThis policy 𝜋induces a stochastic dynamic process on 𝑆evolving in discrete time steps 𝑘∈Z≥0. In this section\nwe consider only stationary policies, and therefore use the terms policy and decision rule interchangeably.\n3.1.2\nKleisli Composites in a Markov Decision Process. Note that for a fixed decision rule 𝜋, we get a Kleisli arrow\n𝑇𝜋: 𝑆→𝑃(𝑆) defined as 𝑇𝜋(𝑠) = 𝑇(𝑠)(𝜋(𝑠)).\nConventionally, 𝑇𝜋is represented as a row-stochastic matrix (𝑇𝜋)𝑠𝑠′ that acts on the probability co-vectors\nfrom the right, so that the row 𝑠of 𝑇𝜋corresponding to state 𝑠encodes the probability distribution of states 𝑠′\nafter a transition from the state 𝑠.\nLet 𝑝𝑘∈𝑃(𝑆) for 𝑘∈Z≥0 denote a probability distribution on 𝑆evolving under the policy stochastic map 𝑇𝜋\nafter 𝑘transition steps, so that 𝑝0 is the initial probability distribution on 𝑆(the initial distribution is usually\ntaken to be ret 𝑠0 for a state 𝑠0). These are related by\n𝑝𝑘= 𝑝0𝑇𝑘\n𝜋\n(10)\nIn general (if 𝑝0 = ret 𝑠0) the number 𝑝𝑘(𝑠) gives the probability that starting out at 𝑠0, one ends up at 𝑠after 𝑘\nstages. So, for example, if 𝑘= 1, we recover the stochastic transition structure at the end of the first step ✿.\n2There are various definitions of finite. Our mechanization uses surjective finiteness (the existence of a surjection from a bounded set of\nnatural numbers)✿, and assumes that there is a decidable equality on 𝑆. This pair of assumptions is equivalent to bijectve finitness.\n3if the decision rule takes a state and returns a probability distribution on actions instead, it is called stochastic.\nCertRL: Formalizing Convergence Proofs for Value and Policy Iteration in Coq\nInstead of representing 𝑇𝑘\n𝜋as an iterated product of a stochastic matrix in our formalization, we recognize that\n(10) states that 𝑝𝑘is the 𝑘-fold iterated Kleisli composite of 𝑇𝜋applied to the initial distribution 𝑝0 ✿.\n𝑝𝑘= (𝑝0\n𝑇𝜋\n. . .\n𝑇𝜋\n|            {z            }\n𝑘times\n)\n(11)\nThus, we bypass the need to define matrices and matrix multiplication entirely in the formalization.\n3.1.3\nLong-Term Value of a Markov Decision Process. Since the transition from one state to another by an action\nis governed by a probability distribution 𝑇, there is a notion of expected reward with respect to that distribution.\nDefinition 8 (Expected immediate reward). For a Markov decision process,\n• An expected immediate reward to be obtained in the transition under action 𝑎from state 𝑠to state 𝑠′ is a\nfunction ¯𝑟: 𝑆→𝐴→R computed by averaging the reward function over the stochastic transition map to a\nnew state 𝑠′\n¯𝑟(𝑠,𝑎) :=\n∑︁\n𝑠′∈𝑆\n𝑟(𝑠,𝑎,𝑠′)𝑇(𝑠,𝑎)(𝑠′)\n(12)\n• An expected immediate reward under a decision rule 𝜋, denoted ¯𝑟𝜋: 𝑆→R is defined to be:\n¯𝑟𝜋(𝑠) := ¯𝑟(𝑠, 𝜋(𝑠)) ✿\n(13)\nThat is, we replace the action argument in (12) by the action prescribed by the decision rule 𝜋.\n• The expected reward at time step 𝑘of a Markov decision process starting at initial state 𝑠, following policy 𝜋\nis defined as the expected value of the reward with respect to the 𝑘-th Kleisli iterate of 𝑇𝜋starting at state 𝑠.\n𝑟𝜋\n𝑘(𝑠) := E𝑇𝑘𝜋(𝑠) [¯𝑟𝜋] =\n∑︁\n𝑠′∈𝑆\nh\n¯𝑟𝜋(𝑠′)𝑇𝑘\n𝜋(𝑠)(𝑠′)\ni\n✿\nThe long-term value of a Markov decision process under a policy 𝜋is defined as follows:\nDefinition 9 (Long-Term Value). Let 𝛾∈R, 0 ≤𝛾< 1 be a discount factor, and 𝜋= (𝜋, 𝜋, . . . ) be a stationary\npolicy. Then 𝑉𝜋: 𝑆→R is given by\n𝑉𝜋(𝑠) =\n∞\n∑︁\n𝑘=0\n𝛾𝑘𝑟𝜋\n𝑘(𝑠) ✿\n(14)\nThe rewards being bounded in absolute value implies that the long-term value function 𝑉𝜋is well-defined for\nevery initial state ✿.\nIt can be shown by manipulating the series in (14) that the long-term value satisfies the Bellman equation:\n𝑉𝜋(𝑠) = ¯𝑣(𝑠, 𝜋(𝑠)) + 𝛾\n∑︁\n𝑠′∈𝑆\n𝑉𝜋(𝑠′)𝑇𝜋(𝑠)(𝑠′) ✿\n(15)\n= ¯𝑟𝜋(𝑠) + 𝛾E𝑇𝜋(𝑠) [𝑉𝜋]\n(16)\nDefinition 10. Given a Markov decision process, we define the Bellman operator as\nB𝜋:(𝑆→R) →(𝑆→R)\n(17)\n𝑊↦→¯𝑟𝜋(𝑠) + 𝛾E𝑇𝜋(𝑠)𝑊\n(18)\nTheorem 11 (Properties of the Bellman Operator ✿). The Bellman operator satisfies the following properties:\n• As is evident from (15), the long-term value 𝑉𝜋is the fixed point of the operator B𝜋✿.\n• The operator B𝜋(called the Bellman operator) is a contraction in the norm (2) ✿.\nVajjha et al.\n• The operator B𝜋is a monotone operator. That is,\n∀𝑠,𝑊1(𝑠) ≤𝑊2(𝑠) ⇒∀𝑠, B𝜋(𝑊1)(𝑠) ≤B𝜋(𝑊2)(𝑠)\nThe Banach fixed point theorem now says that 𝑉𝜋is the unique fixed point of this operator.\nLet 𝑉𝜋,𝑛: 𝑆→R be the 𝑛-th iterate of the Bellman operator 𝐵𝜋. It can be computed by the recursion relation\n𝑉𝜋,0(𝑠0) = 0\n𝑉𝜋,𝑛+1(𝑠0) = ¯𝑟𝜋(𝑠0) + 𝛾E𝑇𝜋(𝑠0)𝑉𝜋,𝑛\n𝑛∈Z≥0\n(19)\nwhere 𝑠0 is an arbitrary initial state. The first term in the reward function 𝑉𝜋,𝑛+1 for the process of length 𝑛+ 1 is\nthe sum of the reward collected in the first step (immediate reward), and the remaining total reward obtained in\nthe subsequent process of length 𝑛(discounted future reward). The 𝑛-th iterate is also seen to be equal to the 𝑛-th\npartial sum of the series (14) ✿.\nThe sequence of iterates {𝑉𝜋,𝑛}|𝑛=0,1,2,... is convergent and equals 𝑉𝜋, by the Banach fixed point theorem.\n𝑉𝜋= lim\n𝑛→∞𝑉𝜋,𝑛✿\n(20)\n3.2\nConvergence of Value Iteration\nIn the previous subsection we defined the long-term value function 𝑉𝜋and showed that it is the fixed point of the\nBellman operator. It is also the pointwise limit of the iterates 𝑉𝜋,𝑛, which is the expected value of all length 𝑛\nrealizations of the Markov decision process following a fixed stationary policy 𝜋.\nWe note that the value function 𝑉𝜋induces a partial order on the space of all decision rules; with 𝜎≤𝜏if and\nonly if 𝑉𝜎≤𝑉𝜏✿.\nThe space of all decision rules is finite because the state and action spaces are finite ✿.\nThe above facts imply the existence of a decision rule (stationary policy) which maximizes the long-term\nreward. We call this stationary policy the optimal policy and its long-term value the optimal value function.\n𝑉∗(𝑠) = max\n𝜋{𝑉𝜋(𝑠)} ✿\n(21)\nThe aim of reinforcement learning, as we remarked in the introduction, is to have tractable algorithms to find\nthe optimal policy and the optimal value function corresponding to the optimal policy.\nBellman’s value iteration algorithm is such an algorithm, which is known to converge asymptotically to the\noptimal value function. In this section we describe this algorithm and formally prove this convergence property.\nDefinition 12. Given a Markov decision process we define the Bellman optimality operator as:\nˆB :(𝑆→R) →(𝑆→R)\n𝑊↦→𝜆𝑠, max\n𝑎∈𝐴(𝑠)\n\u0000¯𝑟(𝑠,𝑎) + 𝛾E𝑇(𝑠,𝑎) [𝑊]\u0001 ✿\nTheorem 13. The Bellman optimality operator ˆB satisfies the following properties:\n• The operator ˆB is a contraction with respect to the 𝐿∞norm (2) ✿.\n• The operator ˆB is a monotone operator. That is,\n∀𝑠,𝑊1(𝑠) ≤𝑊2(𝑠) ⇒∀𝑠, ˆB(𝑊1)(𝑠) ≤ˆB(𝑊2)(𝑠) ✿\nNow we move on to proving the most important property of ˆB: the optimal value function 𝑉∗is a fixed point\nof ˆB.\nBy Theorem 13 and the Banach fixed point theorem, we know that the fixed point of ˆB exists. Let us denote it\nˆ𝑉. Then we have:\nCertRL: Formalizing Convergence Proofs for Value and Policy Iteration in Coq\nTheorem 14 (Lemma 1 of [FHM18] ✿). For every decision rule 𝜎, we have 𝑉𝜎≤ˆ𝑉.\nProof. Fix a policy 𝜎. Note that for every 𝑓: 𝑆→R, we have B𝜎(𝑓) ≤ˆB(𝑓)✿. In particular, applying this to\n𝑓= 𝑉𝜎and using Theorem 11, we get that 𝑉𝜎= B𝜎(𝑉𝜎) ≤ˆB(𝑉𝜎). Now by contraction coinduction (Theorem 5\nwith 𝐹= ˆB along with Theorem 13) we get that 𝑉𝜎≤ˆ𝑉.\n□\nTheorem 14 immediately implies that 𝑉∗≤ˆ𝑉.\nTo go the other way, we introduce the following policy, called the greedy decision rule.\n𝜎∗(𝑠) := argmax𝑎∈𝐴(𝑠)\n\u0010\n¯𝑟(𝑎,𝑠) + 𝛾E𝑇(𝑠,𝑎) [ ˆ𝑉]\n\u0011\n✿\n(22)\nWe now have the following theorem:\nTheorem 15 (Proposition 1 of [FHM18] ✿). The greedy policy is the policy whose long-term value is the fixed\npoint of ˆB:\n𝑉𝜎∗= ˆ𝑉\nProof. We observe that B𝜎∗( ˆ𝑉) = ˆ𝑉✿. Thus, ˆ𝑉≤B𝜎∗( ˆ𝑉). Note that we have 𝑉𝜎∗is the fixed point of 𝐵𝜎∗by\nTheorem 11. Now applying contraction coinduction with 𝐹= B𝜎∗, we get ˆ𝑉≤𝑉𝜎∗. From Theorem 14 we get that\n𝑉𝜎∗≤ˆ𝑉.\n□\nTheorem 15 implies that 𝑉∗≥ˆ𝑉and so we conclude that 𝑉∗= ˆ𝑉✿.\nThus, the fixed point of the optimal Bellman operator ˆB exists and is equal to the optimal value function.\nStated fully, value iteration proceeds by:\n(1) Initialize a value function 𝑉0 : 𝑆→R.\n(2) Define 𝑉𝑛+1 = ˆB𝑉𝑛for 𝑛≥0. At each stage, the following policy is computed\n𝜋𝑛(𝑠) ∈argmax𝑎∈𝐴(𝑠)\n\u0000¯𝑟(𝑠,𝑎) + 𝛾E𝑇(𝑠,𝑎) [𝑉𝑛]\u0001\nBy the Banach Fixed Point Theorem, the sequence {𝑉𝑛} converges to the optimal value function 𝑉∗✿. In\npractice, one repeats this iteration as many times as needed until a fixed threshold is breached.\nIn Section 3.4 we explain and provide a formalized proof of the dynamic programming principle: the value\nfunction𝑉𝑛is equal to the optimal value function of a finite-horizon MDP of length𝑛with a possibly non-stationary\noptimal policy.\n3.3\nConvergence of Policy Iteration\nThe convergence of value iteration is asymptotic, which means the iteration is continued until a fixed threshold\nis breached. Policy iteration is a similar iterative algorithm that benefits from a more definite stopping condition.\nDefine the 𝑄function to be:\n𝑄𝜋(𝑠,𝑎) := ¯𝑟(𝑠,𝑎) + 𝛾E𝑇(𝑠,𝑎) [𝑉𝜋].\nThe policy iteration algorithm proceeds in the following steps:\n(1) Initialize the policy to 𝜋0.\n(2) Policy evaluation: For 𝑛≥0, given 𝜋𝑛, compute 𝑉𝜋𝑛.\n(3) Policy improvement: From 𝑉𝜋𝑛, compute the greedy policy:\n𝜋𝑛+1(𝑠) ∈argmax𝑎∈𝐴(𝑠)\n\u0002\n𝑄𝜋𝑛(𝑠,𝑎)\n\u0003\n(4) Check if 𝑉𝜋𝑛= 𝑉𝜋𝑛+1. If yes, stop.\n(5) If not, repeat (2) and (3).\nThis algorithm depends on the following results for correctness. We follow the presentation from [FHM18].\nVajjha et al.\nDefinition 16 (Improved policy ✿). A policy 𝜏is called an improvement of a policy 𝜎if for all 𝑠∈𝑆it holds that\n𝜏(𝑠) = argmax𝑎∈𝐴(𝑠) [𝑄𝜎(𝑠,𝑎)]]\nSo, step (2) of the policy iteration algorithm simply constructs an improved policy from the previous policy at\neach stage.\nTheorem 17 (Policy Improvement Theorem). Let 𝜎and 𝜏be two policies.\n• If B𝜏𝑉𝜎≥B𝜎𝑉𝜎then 𝑉𝜏≥𝑉𝜎✿.\n• If B𝜏𝑉𝜎≤B𝜎𝑉𝜎then 𝑉𝜏≤𝑉𝜎✿.\nUsing the above theorem, we have:\nTheorem 18 (Policy Improvement Improves Values ✿). If 𝜎and 𝜏are two policies and if 𝜏is an improvement\nof 𝜎, then we have 𝑉𝜏≥𝑉𝜎.\nProof. From Theorem 17, it is enough to show B𝜏𝑉𝜎≥B𝜎𝑉𝜎. We have that 𝜏is an improvement of 𝜎.\n𝜏(𝑠) = argmax𝑎∈𝐴(𝑠) [𝑄𝜎(𝑠,𝑎)]\n(23)\n= argmax𝑎∈𝐴(𝑠)\n\u0002¯𝑟(𝑠,𝑎) + 𝛾E𝑇(𝑠,𝑎) [𝑉𝜎]\n\u0003\n(24)\nNote that\nB𝜏𝑉𝜎= ¯𝑟(𝑠,𝜏(𝑠)) + 𝛾E𝑇(𝑠,𝜏(𝑠)) [𝑉𝜎]\n= max\n𝑎∈𝐴(𝑠)\n\u0002¯𝑟(𝑠,𝑎) + 𝛾E𝑇(𝑠,𝑎) [𝑉𝜎]\n\u0003\nby (24)\n≥¯𝑟(𝑠, 𝜎(𝑠)) + 𝛾E𝑇(𝑠,𝜎(𝑠)) [𝑉𝜎]\n= B𝜎𝑉𝜎\n□\nIn other words, since 𝜋𝑛+1 is an improvement of 𝜋𝑛by construction, the above theorem implies that𝑉𝜋𝑛≤𝑉𝜋𝑛+1.\nThis means that 𝜋𝑛≤𝜋𝑛+1.\nThus, the policy constructed in each stage in the policy iteration algorithm is an improvement of the policy\nin the previous stage. Since the set of policies is finite ✿, this policy list must at some point stabilize. Thus, the\nalgorithm is guaranteed to terminate.\nIn Section 3.4 we will provide formalization of the statement that 𝜋𝑛is actually the optimal policy to follow for\nan MDP process of any finite length at that timestep when 𝑛steps remain towards the end of the process.\n3.4\nOptimal policy for finite time horizon Markov decision processes\nAll results up to this subsection were stated in terms of the convergences of infinite sequences of states and\nactions. Stating convergence results in terms of the limits of infinite sequences is not uncommon in texts on\nreinforcement learning; however, in practice, reinforcement learning algorithms are always run for a finite\nnumber of steps. In this section we consider decision processes of finite length and do not impose an assumption\nthat the optimal policy is stationary.\nLet 𝑉¯𝜋denote the value function of Markov decision process for a finite sequence of policies ¯𝜋= 𝜋0 :: 𝜋1 :: 𝜋2 ::\n. . . 𝜋𝑛−1 of length 𝑛= len( ¯𝜋). Denote by 𝑝0 the probability distribution over the initial state at the start of the\nprocess.\nWe define the probability measure at step 𝑘in terms of Kleisli iterates for each decision rule 𝜋𝑖for 𝑖in 0 . . .

The optimal value function ˆ𝑉∗,𝑛+1 of a Markov\ndecision process of length 𝑛+ 1 relates to the optimal value function of the same Markov decision process of length 𝑛\nby the inductive relation\nˆ𝑉∗,𝑛+1 = ˆB𝑉∗,𝑛\n(32)\nwhere ˆB is Bellman optimality operator (Definition 12).\nThe iterative computation of the sequence of optimal value functions { ˆ𝑉∗,𝑛}𝑛∈Z≥0 of Markov decision processes\nof length 𝑛= 0, 1, 2, . . . from the recursion ˆ𝑉∗,𝑛+1 = ˆB ˆ𝑉∗,𝑛is the same algorithm as value iteration.\n3.5\nComments on Formalization\nCertRL contributes a formal library for reasoning about Markov decision processes. We demonstrate the effec-\ntiveness of this library’s building blocks by proving the two most canonical results from reinforcement learning\ntheory. In this section we reflect on the structure of CertRL’s formalization, substantiating our claim that CertRL\nserves as a convenient foundations for a continuing line of work on formalization of reinforcement learning\ntheory.\nVajjha et al.\n3.5.1\nCharacterizing Optimality. Most texts on Markov decision processses (for example [Put94, Section 2.1.6])\nstart out with a probability space on the space of all possible realizations of the Markov decision process. The\nlong-term value for an infinite-horizon Markov decision process is then defined as the expected value over all\npossible realizations:\n𝑉𝜋(𝑠) = E(𝑥1,𝑥2,... )\n\" ∞\n∑︁\n𝑘=0\n𝛾𝑘𝑣(𝑥𝑘, 𝜋(𝑥𝑘))|𝑥0 = 𝑠; 𝜋\n#\n(33)\nwhere each 𝑥𝑘is drawn from the distribution 𝑇(𝑥𝑘−1, 𝜋(𝑥𝑘−1)). This definition is hard to work with because, as\n[Put94] notes, it ignores the dynamics of the problem. Fortunately, it is also unnecessary since statements about\nthe totality of all realizations are rarely made.\nIn our setup, following [FHM18], we only consider the probability space over the finite set of states of the\nMarkov decision process. By identifying the basic operation of Kleisli composition, we generate more realizations\n(and their expected rewards) on the fly as and when needed.\nImplementations of reinforcement learning algorithms often compute the long-term value using matrix\noperators for efficiency reasons. The observation that clean theoretical tools do not necessarily entail efficient\nimplementations is not a new observation; both Puterman [Put94] and Hölzl [Hoe17a] make similar remarks.\nFortunately, the design of our library provides a clean interface for future work on formalizing efficiency\nimprovements. Extending CertRL with correctness theorems for algorithms that use matrix operations requires\nnothing more than a proof that the relevant matrix operations satisfy the definition of Kleisli composition.\n3.5.2\nComparison of English and Coq Proofs. Comparing Theorem 14 and Theorem 15 with the the equivalent\nresults from Puterman [Put94, Theorem 6.2.2] demonstrates that CertRL avoids reasoning about low-level 𝜖−𝛿\ndetails through strategic use of coinduction.\nThe usefulness of contraction coinduction is reflected in the formalization, sometimes resulting in Coq proofs\nwhose length is almost the same as the English text.\nWe compare in Table 1 the Coq proof of Theorem 15 to an English proof of the same. The two proofs are roughly\nequivalent in length and, crucially, also make essentially the same argument at the same level of abstraction. Note\nthat what we compare is not exactly the proof from Feys et al. [FHM18, Proposition 1], but is as close as possible\nto a restatement of their Proposition 1 and Lemma 1 with the proof of Lemma 1 inlined and the construction\nrestated in terms of our development. The full proof from [FHM18], with Lemma 1 inlined, reads as follows:\nProposition 1: The greedy policy is optimal. That is, 𝐿𝑇𝑉𝜎∗= 𝑉∗.\n(1) Observe that Ψ𝜎∗≥𝑉∗(in fact, equality holds).\n(2) By contraction coinduction, 𝑉∗≤𝐿𝑇𝑉𝜎∗.\n(3) Lemma 1: For all policies 𝜎, 𝐿𝑇𝑉𝜎≤𝑉∗.\n(4) A straightforward calculation and monotonicity argument shows that for all 𝑓∈𝐵(𝑆, R), Ψ𝜎(𝑓) ≤\nΨ∗(𝑓).\n(5) In particular, 𝐿𝑇𝑉𝜎= Ψ𝜎(𝐿𝑇𝑉𝜎) ≤Ψ∗(𝐿𝑇𝑉𝜎).\n(6) By contraction coinduction we conclude that 𝐿𝑇𝑉𝜎≤𝑉∗.\nTable 1 compares two coinductive proofs – one in English and the other in Coq. Another important comparison is\nbetween a Coq coinductive proof and an English non-coinductive proof. The Coq proof of the policy improvement\ntheorem provides one such point of comparison. Recall that theorem states that a particular closed property\n(the set {𝑥|𝑥≤𝑦}) holds of the fixed point of a particular contractive map (the Bellman operator). The most\ncommon argument – presented in the most common textbook on reinforcement learning – proves this theorem\nby expanding the infinite sum in multiple steps [SB98, Section 4.2]. We reproduce this below:\nCertRL: Formalizing Convergence Proofs for Value and Policy Iteration in Coq\nTheorem 15 (Proposition 1 of [FHM18] ✿).

Comparison of English and Coq proofs of Theorem 15.\nTheorem 21 (Policy Improvement Theorem [SB98]). Let 𝜋, 𝜋′ be a pair of deterministic policies such that, for\nall states 𝑠,\n𝑄𝜋(𝑠, 𝜋′(𝑠)) ≥𝑉𝜋(𝑠)\n(34)\nthen 𝑉𝜋′(𝑠) ≥𝑉𝜋(𝑠).\nProof.

By completeness and using the fact that partial sums converge to the full series 𝑉𝜋, this\nproperty is also shown to hold of the fixed point 𝑉𝜋.\nHowever, the coinductive version of this proof (Theorem 17) is simpler because it exploits the fact that this\nconstruction has already been done once in the proof of the fixed point theorem: the iterates of the contraction\noperator were already proven to converge to the fixed point and so there is no reason to repeat the construction\nagain. Thus, the proof is reduced to simply establishing the “base case” of the (co)induction.\nThe power of this method goes beyond simplifying proofs for Markov decision processes. See [KR09] for other\nexamples.\n4\nRELATED AND FUTURE WORK\nTo our knowledge, CertRL is the first formal proof of convergence for value iteration or policy iteration. Related\nwork falls into three categories:\n(1) libraries that CertRL builds upon,\n(2) formalizations of results from probability and machine learning, and\n(3) work at the intersection of formal verification and reinforcement learning.\nDependencies. CertRL builds on the Coquelicot [BLM14] library for real analysis. Our main results are statements\nabout fixed points of contractive maps in complete normed modules. CertRL therefore builds on the formal\ndevelopment of the Lax-Milgram theorem and, in particular, Boldo et al.’s formal proof of the Banach fixed point\ntheorem [BCF+17]. CertRL also makes extensive use of some utilities from the Q*cert project [AHM+17]. CertRL\nincludes a bespoke implementation of some basic results and constructions from probability theory and also an\nimplementation of the Giry monad. Our use of the monad for reasoning about probabilistic processes, as well as\nthe design of our library, is highly motivated by the design of the Polaris library [TH19]. Many of the thorough\nformalizations of probabilities in Coq – such as the Polaris [TH19], Infotheo [AH12], and Alea [APM09] – also\ncontain these results. Refactoring CertRL to build on top of one or more of these formalizations might allow\nfuture work on certified reinforcement learning to leverage future improvements to these libraries.\nBuilding on these other foundations, CertRL demonstrates how existing work on formalization enables\nformalization of key results in reinforcement learning theory.\nRelated Formalizations. There is a growing body of work on formalization of machine learning theory [TTV19,\nTTV+20, Hoe17b, SLD17, BS19, BBK19].\nJohannes Hölzl’s Isabelle/HOL development of Markov processes is most related to our own work [Hoe17b,\nHoe17a]. Hölzl builds on the probability theory libraries of Isabelle/HOL to develop continuous-time Markov\nchains. Many of Hölzl’s basic design choices are similar to ours; for example, he also uses the Giry monad to\nplace a monadic structure on probability spaces and also uses coinductive methods. CertRL focuses instead on\nformalization of convergence proofs for dynamic programming algorithms that solve Markov decision processes.\nIn the future, we plan to extend our formalization to include convergence proofs for model-free methods, in\nwhich a fixed Markov decision process is not known a priori.\nThe CertiGrad formalization by Selsam et al. contains a Lean proof that the gradients sampled by a stochastic\ncomputation graph are unbiased estimators of the true mathematical function [SLD17]. This result, together with\nour development of a library for proving convergence of reinforcement learning algorithms, provides a path\ntoward a formal proof of correctness for deep reinforcement learning.\nFormal Methods for RL. The likelihood that reinforcement learning algorithms will be deployed in safety-\ncritical settings during the coming decades motivates a growing body of work on formal methods for safe\nreinforcement learning. This approach – variously called formally constrained reinforcement learning [HAK18],\nCertRL: Formalizing Convergence Proofs for Value and Policy Iteration in Coq\nshielding[ABE+18], or verifiably safe reinforcement learning [HFM+20] – uses temporal or dynamic logics to\nspecify constraints on the behavior of RL algorithms.\nGlobal convergence is a fundamental theoretical property of classical reinforcement learning algorithms, and\nin practice at least local convergence is an important property for any useful reinforcement learning algorithm.\nHowever, the formal proofs underlying these methods typically establish the correctness of a safety constraint\nbut do not formalize any convergence properties. In future work, we plan to establish an end-to-end proof that\nconstrained reinforcement learning safely converges by combining our current development with the safe RL\napproach of Fulton et al. [FP18] and the VeriPhy pipeline of Bohrer et al. [BTM+18].\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nReinforcement learning algorithms are an important class of machine learning algorithms that are now being\ndeployed in safety-critical settings. Ensuring the correctness of these algorithms is societally important, but prov-\ning properties about stochastic processes presents several challenges. In this paper we show how a combination\nof metric coinduction and the Giry monad provides a convenient setting for formalizing convergence proofs for\nreinforcement learning algorithms.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Larry Moss, Sylvie Boldo and Mark Squillante for discussions related to this paper.
