So it looks natural for them to mix their cultural language with\nEnglish during conversations resulting in abundance of multilingual data – call this code-mixed data,\navailable in today’s world. Downstream NLP tasks using such data is challenging due to the semantic\nnature of it being spread across multiple languages. One such NLP task is Sentiment analysis; for this we\nuse an auto-regressive XLNet model to perform sentiment analysis on code-mixed Tamil-English and\nMalayalam-English datasets.\nKeywords\ncode-mixed, XLNet, auto-regressive, attention\n1. Introduction\nSocial media content results in large data feeds from wide geographies. Since multiple geogra-\nphies are involved, the data is multilingual in nature resulting in code mixing 1 often. Sentiment\nanalysis on code-mixed text allows to gain insights on the trends prevalent in different geogra-\nphies however is a challenge due to the non-trivial nature involved in inferring the semantics\nof such data. In this paper, we address these challenges using XLNet[1]2 framework. We have\nfine tuned the pre-trained XLNet model with the available data without any additional pre-\nprocessing mechanisms. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 illustrates the\nrelated work done in the field. Section 3 explains the dataset and the task. Section 4 demonstrates\nthe approach we used and briefly explains the architecture of XLNet. Results are discussed in\nSection 5.\nFIRE’20:\n\" S.Banerjee3@nuigalway.ie (S.

Related Work\nMultilingual users have the tendency to mix linguistic units in the social media resulting\nin code-mixed data being easily available. The phenomenon of code-mixing is explained in\n[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and provides an analysis on the possible reasons behind code-mixing. This is\ndone by identifying the languages involved in the code-mixed data which looks inevitable. In\nthe past, several approaches were taken and experiments were conducted aimed at the detection\nof languages in code-mixed data [11][12][13]. A review of many research works on code-mixing\nis discussed in [14].\n2.1. Code-mixed data\nSince code-mixed is mostly sourced from social media platforms, the data in it’s raw form is\nhighly unstructured and hence corpus creation to organize this unstructured data into datasets\nfor further analysis pose a challenge. For some of the Indian languages, [15] has compiled a\nTamil-English code-mixed dataset, the first annotated Tanglish3 dataset. Similarly, [16] published\na dataset for Malayalam-English code-mixed data, where the authors also provided references\nto the availability of other code-mixed datasets such as Chinese-English and Spanish-English.\nBut significant work hasn’t been done in the area of corpus creation for code-mixing for Indian\nlanguages. The Indian languages are considered to be under-resourced and so there is less\ninterest in performing NLP tasks on these languages.\n2.2. Sentiment-analysis\nSentiment analysis is a well known NLP task that infers the positive, negative and neutral\nsentiments from a statement in question. However there are very few works on the sentiment\nanalysis over code-mixed data; [17][18] provides an overview of the work done on sentiment\nanalysis of Dravidian code-mixed text. Another work, [19] compares the performance of\ndifferent transformer architectures on the task of sentiment analysis of code-mixed data. [20]\nemployed an approach based on lexicon to assign sentiment to Hindi-English code-mixed text.\n[21] illustrates a method to detect hate speech in code-mixed Hinglish dataset. For the purpose\nof conducting this research they used FIRE 2013 and FIRE 2014 datasets. [22] used a LSTM\n[23] based approach to improve the state-of-art performance [20] on the hinglish datasets by\n18 percent. [24] used shared parameters in a siamese network [25] to project the code-mixed\nsentences and sentences in standard languages into a common sentiment space. The similarity\nof projected sentences is an indicative of how similar their sentiments are, similar sentences\nhave similar sentiment. Ensemble based techniques have also been used for sentiment analysis\nof code-mixed data, [26] proposed an ensemble model of a character-trigrams based LSTM and\na word-ngrams naive bayes to detect the sentiment in Hindi-english code-mixed data. [27]\nhave used a multilayer perceptron to perform sentiment analysis on code-mixed data extracted\nfrom social media platforms. [28] used an ensemble of a convolutional neural network and a\nself-attention based LSTM for sentiment analysis of Spanglish and Hinglish text.\n3Tanglish refers to code switching between Tamil and English, a term predominantly used in the Tamil\ncommunity\nTable 1\nDataset size and splits\nDataset\nTraining\nValidation\nTesting\nTamil-English\n1,335\n1,260\n3,149\nMalayalam-English\n4,716\n674\n1,348\n3. Dataset for sentiment analysis\nIn spoken and written conversations, it is observed that the usage of lexicon, connectives and\nphrases from English are used in combination with other languages; this can very well be seen\nin the social media text and in spoken conversations across geographies, especially in India.\nSentiment Analysis in social media has drawn attention in recent years. However, sentiment\nanalysis on Tamil-English (Tanglish) and Malayalam-English code-mixed data are not readily\navailable for research. The authors of [15] and [16] have collected 184,573 sentences for Tamil\nand 116,711 sentences for Malayalam from YouTube comments which are based on the trailers of\nthe movies released in 2019 for building Tamil-English and Malayalam-English datasets where\nnon-code-mixed sentences were removed from the collection. Further, emoticons were removed\nand sentence length filters were applied to render the mentioned datasets. In the end two data\nsets of size 15,744 and 6,738 sentences were reported for Tanglish and Malayalam-English texts.\nTo get this dataset ready for sentiment analysis [15] and [16] refers to manual annotation\nactivity carried out with three annotators annotating each sentence in the data set. The Krip-\npendorff’s alpha (α) is used to measure inter-annotator agreement which is 0.6585 and 0.890 for\nTamil and Malayalam code-mixed data sets respectively.\nThe dataset was provided for this task in three parts training, validation and testing. The\nnumber of sentences used for the dataset splits are provided in table 1. Both these datasets are\nreleased in DravidianCodeMix FIRE 2020 competition organized by dravidiancodemixed. These\ncomments were grouped into five categories positive, negative, neutral, mixed emotions, or not\nin the intended languages.\n4. Methodology\nLanguage models have been integral to the recent advances made in the field of NLP due to its\nability to predict the next token in a sequence. Traditionally this achieved by computing the\njoint distribution of the tokens in a sequence as a function of conditional probability distribution\nof each token given other tokens in the sequence.\nHowever, XLNet[1] takes a different approach; when these models are trained on large\ndatasets, it achieves state-of-art performances on downstream NLP tasks. This uses permutation\nlanguage modelling, which trains an autoregressive model on all possible permutation of\nwords in a sentence – see equation 1. During prediction of a word in a sequence, it takes into\naccount bidirectional context and predicts the masked tokens on the basis of the words/tokens\nto the right as well as the left of the masked token in the sequence. XLNet is based on the\ntransformer architecture[3], which uses the concept of attention[4] to learn the long range\ntoken dependencies. Another important aspect of XLnet is two-stream attention; this refers\nTable 2\nPrecision, Recall and F-score measures on the Test set\nData\nClasses\nPrecision\nRecall\nF1 Score\nWeighted Average-F1\nAccuracy\nMalayalam-English\nMixed feelings\n0.03\n0.22\n0.05\n0.52\n0.49\nNegative\n0.12\n0.40\n0.19\nPositive\n0.72\n0.50\n0.59\nnot-malayalam\n0.36\n0.58\n0.44\nunknown state\n0.42\n0.46\n0.44\nTamil-English\nMixed feelings\n0.23\n0.13\n0.17\n0.32\n0.35\nNegative\n0.50\n0.16\n0.24\nPositive\n0.39\n0.73\n0.51\nnot-Tamil\n0.10\n0.40\n0.16\nunknown state\n0.03\n0.31\n0.05\nto attention streams working in parallel, one which encodes the content of the tokens and the\nother which incorporates the positional information. This property would be useful and so is\nexploited to perform the sentiment analysis on code-mixed data.\nThe following equation formally describes the language modelling objective using XLNet. In\neqn.1, for a give text sequence x, and set of all permutations of the sequence 𝑍𝑇and z 𝜖𝑍𝑇.\n𝑚\n𝜃𝑎𝑥𝐸𝑧∼𝑍𝑇[\n𝑇\n∑\n𝑡=1\nlog 𝑝𝜃𝑥𝑧𝑡|𝑥𝑧<𝑡) ]\n(1)\nFor the purpose of experiments, we fine-tuned the XLNet model using the given datasets –\nrefer to table 1 and sentiment analysis was conducted on this labelled dataset. The training\nand testing were carried out as per the numbers mentioned in Table 1. Two experiments were\nconducted on the mentioned datasets and for those experiments the XLNet embeddings were\nfine-tuned for 4 epochs each with a maximum learning rate of 0.005 to perform sentiment\nanalysis of the given datasets. Results of the experiments carried out are illustrated in the next\nsection.\n5. Results and Discussion\nThe experiment results for the experiments outlined in the previous section are provided in table\n2. We were able to achieve 0.49 & 0.35 accuracies and 0.52 & 0.32 F-scores on both the datasets\nrespectively. The results are biased towards Positive class because of the class-imbalance seen in\nthe training set. Further, it can be seen that the model performs better on the Malayalam-English\ndataset despite the Tanglish dataset having more samples; this can be attributed to more noise\nin the Tamil-English data and hence relatively poor performance. Our results do not perform\nbetter than the baseline-results described in [15] and [16]. We hypothesize that these results\ncan further be improved by training the model for more epochs with a pre-processing step\nperformed in combination with oversampling and undersampling of the minority and majority\nclasses respectively.\nReferences\n[1] Z.
