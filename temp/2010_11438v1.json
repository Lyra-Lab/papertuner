INTRODUCTION\nSemantic segmentation is one of the central tasks in microscope image analysis, which segments targeting objects\nfrom background context.1 Traditionally, the semantic segmentation was performed by unsupervised intensity\nbased methods, such as watershed,2 Gaussian mixture model (GMM),3 graph-cut4 etc. In the past few years,\nthe deep learning based methods have been increasingly popular in microscopy imaging, due to the superior\naccuracy and better generalizability.5 However, one of the major limitations in deep learning based semantic\nsegmentation is the need of large-scale annotated images, which is not only tedious, but also resource intensive.6\nCycleGAN,7 a breakthrough generative adversarial network (GAN)8 was proposed recently, which shed light on\nsemantic segmentation with minimal or even no manual annotation.9–12\nWithin the CycleGAN framework,7 many previous studies have tackled the unsupervised semantic segmen-\ntation in microscopy imaging. Ihle et al.13 proposed to use the CycleGAN framework to segment bright-ﬁeld\nimages of cell cultures, a live-dead assay of C.Elegans, and X-ray-computed tomography of metallic nanowire\nmeshes. A similar approach was proposed by14 for facilitating stain-independent supervised and unsupervised\nsegmentation on kidney histology. DeepSynth15 was proposed to further extend the CycleGAN framework from\n2D to 3D nuclear segmentation. Even though the CycleGAN based unsupervised segmentation approaches have\nshown decent performance on microscope images, very few studies have investigated the challenging sub-cellular\nmicrovilli segmentation with ﬂuorescence microscopy imaging. The sub-cellular microvilli segmentation is chal-\nlenging due to the highly overlapping and dynamic nature of such small sub-celluar objects.16,17\nDiﬀerent from Pix2Pix GAN,18 which requires pixel-level matching between images across two domains,\nCycleGAN is able to perform image synthesis without paired images. However, the previous studies emphasized\nFurther author information: Quan Liu : E-mail: quan.liu@vanderbilt.edu\nContact Author: Yuankai Huo: E-mail: yuankai.huo@vanderbilt.edu\narXiv:2010.11438v1  [cs.CV]  22 Oct 2020\nMicro-level matching\nCycleGAN\nSimulator\nSimulator\nImages\nMasks\nCycleGAN\nImages\nMasks\nMacro-level matching\nReal \nImages\nReal \nImages\nMicrovilli \nProtein\nMicrovilli \nDistribution\nMicro-level \nMatching\nMacro-level \nMatching\nFigure 1. This ﬁgure shows the general framework of the image synthesis. CycleGAN is the used to perform synthesis\nbetween real images and simulated masks. In micro-level matching, the green protein channel in ﬂuorescence images is\nused to achieve the cell counting automatically, which provides the rough numbers of microvilli in the real images. Then,\nthe corresponding simulated masks with the same numbers of sticks are generated from the simulator when forming a\nmini-batch for training. In macro-level matching, the numbers of sticks in the simulated masks are randomly generated\nfrom the prior global distribution, without mini-batch level correspondence.\nthat the macro-level (global distribution level) matching on the number of objects between intensity images and\nsimulated masks improved the segmentation performance.13 That fact inspired us with the question that if the\nsegmentation performance could be further improved by doing more careful matching than the macro-level. To\nanswer the question, we propose a new micro-level matching (mini-batch level) strategy to match the rough\nnumber of objects across two domains when training the CycleGAN framework.\nIn this paper, we develop a deep learning based unsupervised semantic segmentation method for sub-cellular\nmicrovilli segmentation using ﬂuorescence microscopy. Meanwhile, we evaluate the performance of micro-level\nmatching strategy, which is enabled by the multi-channel nature of ﬂuorescence images. The contributions of this\nstudy are three-fold: (1) We propose the ﬁrst deep learning based unsupervised sub-cellular microvilli segmenta-\ntion method; (2) We propose the micro-level matching to ensure the roughly same number of objects across two\nmodalities within each mini-batch, without introducing extra human annotation eﬀorts; (3) Comprehensive anal-\nyses are provided to evaluate the outcomes of diﬀerent augmentation strategies when generating the simulated\nmasks for unsupervised microvilli segmentation.\n2. METHODS\nOur proposed unsupervised segmentation method consists of two parts: (1) image synthesis, and (2) segmenta-\ntion. In image synthesis, our goal is to synthesize realistic looking images from the simulated masks. Then, the\npaired synthetic images and masks are used to train another segmentation network. Note that, no manual\nannotations are used in our training either for CycleGAN or U-Net, as an unsupervised frame-\nwork.\n2.1 Cycle-Consistent Image Synthesis\nThe CycleGAN7 is used to generate our synthetic training data. As the standard CycleGAN implementation,\ngenerators and discriminators are used to transfer the styles between two image modalities. The role of the\ngenerators is to convert the real images to another domain, which are typically called ”fake” images.\nThe\ndiscriminators then judge if a given image is real or fake. The CycleGAN model design creatively forms the\nSimulator\nSmooth\nSmooth + Noise + Brightness\nSmooth + Noise\nSimulator\nAugmentation\n𝑀𝐴\nCycleGAN\nCycleGAN\n𝑀\n𝐼\nFigure 2. This ﬁgure demonstrates four experimental designs of providing diﬀerent augmentations of masks for training\nthe CycleGAN. The ﬁrst design employs the binary mask directly, while the remaining three designs utilize diﬀerent\naugmentation strategies.\nentire learning process as a cycle-consistent loop, where the reconstructed fake images after two generators\nshould be close to the original real images. In each branch, the generator tries to generate realistic images, while\nthe discriminator try to distinguish the fake images from the real ones.\nIn our unsupervised image segmentation framework (Fig. 1), the CycleGAN is employed to synthesize seg-\nmentation masks (or called ”annotations”) from the real images I, and synthesize realistic looking images from\nsimulated segmentation masks M. In the ideal case, the trained generator GI−>M can be directly used as a\nsegmentation network to segment new images. However, the quality of synthesis between real images and clean\nbinary masks is typically not optimal since the underlying Poisson distribution of the binary masks is not a re-\nalistic distribution in real images.13 Moreover, the optimization of the KL divergence for training discriminators\nis more diﬃcult to converge14 using clean binary masks. Therefore, the Gaussian smoothing, random noise, and\nbrightness variations are used to generate augmented masks MA in additional to the simulated mask images\nM for better synthetic performance (Fig. 2). Then, the trained generator GMA−>I will provide us unlimited\nfake but realistic looking images IF from the simulated and augmented masks MA. Eventually, the fake images\nIF and the clean binary masks MA (before augmentation) are used to train another independent segmentation\nnetwork (see Image Segmentation section).\n2.2 Micro- and Macro-level Matching\nCompared with traditional pixel-to-pixel conditional GAN design which needs pixel-level correspondence be-\ntween two modalities, the CycleGAN does not need paired images for training. However, the superior synthetic\nsegmentation performance is typically achieved if the distributions of the number of objects in real image modal-\nity and annotation modality are roughly matched,13,14 named as ”macro-level” matching. However, no studies\nhave explored the level of matching in the middle of pixel-level and macro-level. In this study, we proposed\nthe idea called ”micro-level” matching, which matches the number of objects in each mini-batch (Fig. 1). For\nexample, if a real image has roughly 21 microvilli, we will provide a simulated mask with the same 21 sticks,\nwhen forming the mini-batch. Then, the next question is that how can we get rough number of objects from the\nreal images. In this study, we utilize the multi-channel nature of ﬂuorescence microscopy to split the microvilli\nmarker mCherry-Espin (magenta color objects) and microvilli tip marker EGFP-EPS8 (green color objects).\nUsing the simple intensity thresholding based cell counting algorithm,19 the rough number of protein objects are\neasily achieved. The numbers are then used as the rough number of microvilli to simulate the corresponding\nmask ﬁles with the same number of objects, as the micro-level matching. Note that we only match the number\nof the objects in the micro-level matching, where the spatial distribution of the objects is still random.\nGenerator\nIn CycleGAN\nU-Net\nSegmentations\nSynthetic Images\nSimulated Masks\nDice Loss\nAugmented Masks\nFigure 3. This ﬁgure shows the segmentation pipeline. The input images of the U-Net model are the synthetic fake images\nfrom trained CycleGAN’s generator, while the annotations the simulated masks. Note that, no manual annotations are\nused in our training either for CycleGAN or U-Net, as an unsupervised framework.\n2.3 Image Segmentation\nU-Net20 is employed as the segmentation backbone network, which is a fully convolutional neural network and\nwidely used in image segmentation tasks. The segmentation part of our framework is shown in Fig. 3. In our\nproposed unsupervised segmentation framework, the input images of U-Net are the fake microvilli images, which\nare generated from the simulated masks using GM−>I or GMA−>I from trained CycleGAN. Then the Dice loss\nfunction is calculated by comparing the predicted segmentation with the simulated binary masks. Traditional\ndeep neural network typically needs a large number of annotated images to train a segmentation network. Using\nour design, however, we can generate unlimited number of training data to train the segmentation network\nwithout any manual annotation eﬀorts.\n3. DATA AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\n3.1 Microvilli Images\nTwelve microvilli images acquired using ﬂuorescence microscopy were used as training data, where each image\nhad ≈900 × 900 pixels with pixel resolution 1.1 µm. Then, 500 image patches with 128 × 128 pixels were ran-\ndomly sampled from the twelve images to train the CycleGAN as the real images. Then, another independent\nmicrovilli video with 20 frames was used as testing data to evaluate the performance of the proposed unsu-\npervised segmentation methods. Each frame has 256 × 256 pixels with pixel resolution 1.1 µm. All microvilli\nin each frame were densely annotated manually by an experienced biologist as the gold standard segmenta-\ntion. The video of microvilli frames and manual annotations are presented in the supplementary materials:\nhttps://github.com/iamliuquan/GAN based segmentation.\n3.2 Experimental Design\nIn order to test if micro-level matching can improve the unsupervised segmentation performance, we performed\nexperiments using both macro-level and micro-level matching. For micro-level matching, the number of sticks of\neach images was obtained by automatically counting the number of green proteins. For macro-level matching,\nthe number of sticks for each image was randomly sampled from a uniform distribution (range from 11 to 63),\naccording to distribution of proteins.\nAs shown in Fig 2, we have four diﬀerent augmentation settings to generate the simulated masks in annotation\ndomain:\nBinary masks: The binary masks were directly simulated as the images in the annotation domain, without\nany augmentation. Based on17 and the prior biological knowledge of microvilli, the width of each microvilli was\nsimulated between 2 to 5 µm, while the length was simulated between 10 to 50 µm. As the pixel resolution of\nall our images was 1.1 µm, we randomly generated sticks with 2 to 4 pixels width and 9 to 45 pixels length from\nuniform distribution.\nGaussian Smoothing: The ﬁrst augmentation was Gasussian smoothing, where a Gaussian ﬁlter with kernal\nsize of 5 × 5 was applied to the binary masks.\nRandom noise: Upon the Gaussian smoothing, the random Gaussian noise was further applied to the entire\n25\n15\n35\n45\n55\nMicro Level Matching\nMacro Level Matching\nUnpaired Example \nReal Images \nSimulated \nMasks\nGaussian Smooth\nRandom Noise\nDifferent Brightness\nNumbers of Objects\nFigure 4.

The values of random noise ranged from 0 to 255 follows Gaussian distribution.\nDiﬀerent brightness: To further introduce the global intensity variations, random intensity values (200 to\n255) were assigned to each stick in binary masks, where maximum foreground intensity value was 255.\nTo improve the segmentation performance, CycleGAN was employed to synthesis cell images for U-Net model\ntraining. In our experiment, CycleGAN is used to learn the mapping from simulated masks to real microvilli\ncell images. We built up dataset in these two domains as CycleGAN model’s input. Our CycleGAN model was\ntrained for 60 epochs. According to the training loss, generator trained for 50 epochs shows the best performance.\nGenerator trained in CycleGAN will be used to synthesis microvilli cell images based on simulated mask images.\nCycleGAN model cannot cover all details using original frames as input which has too many cells. For both\nCycleGAN and U-Net, the input images were all with 128 × 128 resolution cropped from original frames, and\nthen resized to 256 × 256 during training.\nWhen applying trained U-Net on testing microvilli images, each\ntesting image was ﬁrst split to four 128×128 images, and the ﬁnal segmentation were achieved by concatenating\nthe corresponding four predictions back to the original resolution.\nThe Dice results were calculated in the\noriginal 256 × 256 resolution for testing images. The CycleGAN and U-Net were deployed on a computer with\nGeForce GTX 1060 Graphic Card with 6 GB memory. To get better synthesised data and avoid over-ﬁtting, the\nCycleGAN was trained with 50 epochs and the U-Net was trained with 10 epochs for all experiments. According\nto the prediction performance, U-Net has the best performance after 10 epochs.

RESULTS\nConsidering both micro- and macro-level matching with diﬀerent augmentation strategies, we performed eight\nexperiments by training eight diﬀerent CycleGAN networks. The qualitative results of image synthesis from\neight diﬀerent CycleGAN networks are provided in Fig. 4.\nThen, the synthetic images were used to train eights diﬀerent U-Net models using synthetic training im-\nage patches and applied to the real testing images. For testing images, the manual annotation was performed\nby tracking center line fragments of each microvillus (annotated by experienced biologist) since the traditional\ncontour based annotations were extremely diﬃcult on the tiny sub-cellular structures. To evaluate the segmen-\ntation results, we assigned diﬀerent width to the manual segmentation and reported the results in Table. 1. The\ncorresponding qualitative results of segmentation are provided in Fig. 5. According to microvilli cell’s biologic\ncharacteristic, manual annotation images are presented with width=3. From the results, the macro-level match-\ning with Gaussian smoothing and random noise achieved the best performance across diﬀerent widths of manual\nannotation. The micro-level matching did not improve the segmentation performance. Micro-level pairing can\nachieve higher accuracy on training dataset because its pairing is detailed to ﬁt training dataset properties.\nMacro-level pairing is more robust. U-Net model trained by macro-level pairing performs better than micro-level\npairing on new dataset. The standard Dice similarity coeﬃcient metrics were used to evaluate diﬀerent methods.\nThe video of microvilli frames and our unsupervised segmentation results are presented in the supplementary\nmaterials: https://github.com/iamliuquan/GAN based segmentation.\n5. CONCLUSION\nIn this study, we proposed the ﬁrst deep learning solution to enable unsupervised sub-cellular microvilli seg-\nmentation. Beyond the current standard macro-level matching strategy, we utilized the multi-channel nature of\nﬂuorescence microscopy to enable the micro-level matching of the number of objects in each mini-batch without\nintroducing new human annotation eﬀorts. From the experimental results, we conclude that the micro-level\nmatching of object numbers at the mini-batch level did not lead to better segmentation performance. From\nthe comprehensive analyses of introducing noise, smoothness and brightness, the Gaussian smoothing and ran-\ndom noise on the simulated annotations with macro-level matching resulted in the best microvilli segmentation\nperformance.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Wu, K., Gauthier, D., and Levine, M.
