In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised\nmachine learning approach to classify non-Hermitian topological phases based on diffusion maps, which are\nwidely used in manifold learning. We ﬁnd that the non-Hermitian skin effect will pose a notable obstacle,\nrendering the straightforward extension of unsupervised learning approaches to topological phases for Hermitian\nsystems ineffective in clustering non-Hermitian topological phases. Through theoretical analysis and numerical\nsimulations of two prototypical models, we show that this difﬁculty can be circumvented by choosing the “on-\nsite” elements of the projective matrix as the input data. Our results provide a valuable guidance for future\nstudies on learning non-Hermitian topological phases in an unsupervised fashion, both in theory and experiment.\nNon-Hermiticity arises naturally in a wide range of scenar-\nios [1–3], such as photonic systems with loss and gain [4–\n8], open quantum systems [9–12], and quasiparticles with ﬁ-\nnite lifetimes [13–17]. Recently, the study of non-Hermitian\ntopological phases has attracted tremendous attentions [17–\n61]. Exciting progresses have been made in both theory [17–\n51] and experiment [52–61]. One of the prominent phenom-\nena of non-Hermitian systems is the so-called non-Hermitian\nskin effect (NHSE) [39–42], where the majority of the eigen-\nstates of a non-Hermitian operator are exponentially localized\nat boundaries. This leads to the breakdown of the conventional\nbulk-boundary correspondence (a guiding principle for topo-\nlogical phases of Hermitian systems) and calls for the non-\nBloch band theory based on the generalized Brillouin zone\n[32, 41, 42, 50, 51]. The NHSE has been observed in re-\ncent experiments [52, 62, 63], and its physical implications\nand consequences are still under active studies at the current\nstage [23, 25, 42, 50, 64–71]. Here, we introduce an unsuper-\nvised machine learning approach based on diffusion maps to\nclustering non-Hermitian topological phases, with a focus on\nthese exhibiting NHSE that are drastically distinct from their\nHermitian counterparts (see Fig. 1 for a pictorial illustration).\nMachine learning techniques [72–74] are exquisitely tai-\nlored to identify hidden patterns in complex data and their\napplications to physics have recently been invoked in vari-\nous contexts [75–77], ranging from black hole detection [78],\ngravitational lenses [79] and wave analysis [80, 81], and quan-\ntum nonlocality detection [82], to glassy dynamics [83] and\nmaterial design [84], etc.\nWithin the vein of learning dif-\nferent phases of matter and phase transitions, a number of\ndifferent approaches have been proposed, with some been\ndemonstrated in recent experiments. In particular, for learn-\ning topological phases both supervised [85–92] and unsuper-\nvised [93–104] methods have been introduced, despite the\nfact that topological phases are typically more difﬁcult to\nlearn than conventional symmetry-breaking ones due to their\nlack of local order parameters [105]. Supervised methods re-\nquire prior labeling of the data samples, whereas unsupervised\nlearning can detect and classify topological phases from unla-\nbeled raw data, without a priori knowledge of the underlying\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2Phase Diagram (OBC)\nDiffusion Map\n!! −γ\n!! + γ\n!\"\nA\nB\nA\nB\n......\n1D NH SSH model:\nFIG. 1.\nA schematic illustration of the 1D non-Hermitian Su-\nSchrieffer-Heeger (NH SSH) model, and the unsupervised learning\nof its harboring topological phases based on the diffusion map.

Samples from the same phase correspond to the same diago-\nnal blocks of the Gaussian kernel matrix and the boundary between\ntwo blocks indicates the topological phase transition point.\ntopological mechanism. Therefore, to some extent unsuper-\nvised approaches are more powerful and practical in detect-\ning and identifying new topological phases. An intriguing un-\nsupervised approach is based on diffusion maps [106–108],\nwhich naturally implements the notion of continuous defor-\nmation (homotopy) and thus is particularly suitable for clas-\nsifying topological objects. Along this line, notable works\nhave demonstrated that diffusion maps are strikingly effective\nin clustering topological orders in the Ising gauge theory [93],\nsymmetry protected topological phases [94, 95], valence-bond\nsolid [97], and topological phononics [96].\nNevertheless,\nmost of these existing works focus on Hermitian systems and\nlearning of non-Hermitian topological phases, especially for\nthese with NHSE, remains largely unexplored.\nIn this paper, we use diffusion maps to cluster non-\nHermitian topological phases in an unsupervised fashion.\nThrough theoretical analysis, we ﬁnd that the NHSE gives\nrise to unwanted singularities that result in vanishing diffusion\narXiv:2010.14516v3  [cond-mat.mes-hall]  15 Dec 2021\n2\nprobabilities even for data samples from the same topologi-\ncal phase, thus making the direct application of the diffusion\nmap method impotent for classifying non-Hermitian topologi-\ncal phases with skin effect. To overcome this obstacle, we pro-\npose to use only the “on-site” elements {PiA,iB|i ∈[1, N]}\nof the projective matrices P, which are typically used for\ndeﬁning topological indices for non-Hermitian systems, as in-\nput data and show, through concrete examples involving one-\ndimensional (1D) non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)\nand 2D Qi-Wu-Zhang (QWZ) models, that the diffusion map\nmethod is indeed capable of classifying non-Hermitian topo-\nlogical phases without supervision, even for these with the\nNHSE if we use the adjusted input data.\nTheoretical analysis.—Suppose we are given a set of input\ndata D = {x(1), x(2), · · · , x(L)} coming from different non-\nHermitian topological phases. Our goal is to classify these\nsamples topologically, namely, determine the number of dif-\nferent topological phases and for each sample identify which\ncategory it belongs to. To measure the local similarity be-\ntween samples x(l) and x(l′), we use the Gaussian kernel func-\ntion with variance controlled by the parameter ϵ (0 < ϵ ≪1):\nKl,l′ = exp\n\u0010\n−∥x(l)−x(l′)∥2\nL1/(2ϵN 2)\n\u0011\n,\n(1)\nwhere ∥x(l)−x(l′)∥L1 denotes the Taxicab L1-norm distance,\ni.e. ∥⃗A∥L1 = P\ni |Ai|. N denotes the number of unit cells\nof the Hamiltonian. The one-step diffusion probability Pl,l′\nfrom sample x(l) to x(l′) is deﬁned as: Pl,l′ =\nKl,l′\nP\nl′ Kl,l′ .\nAfter 2t steps, the diffusion distance between x(j) and x(j′)\nis Dt(j, j′) = P\nk\n(Pt\nj,k−Pt\nj′,k)2\nP\nl Kk,l\n= P\nk λ2t\nk [(ψk)j−(ψk)j′]2,\nwhere {ψk} are the right eigenvectors of P and {λk} de-\nnotes their corresponding eigenvalues. From Dt, it is clear\nthat in the long-time limit t →∞, only the few components\nwith largest |λ| ≈1 will dominate, and these few compo-\nnents can be used for dimensional reduction and clustering\nnon-Hermintian topological phases.\nThe success of the diffusion map method relies crucially\non the input data samples. For learning topological phases\nin an unsupervised way, two types of data samples have been\nconsidered in previous works [93–97]: bulk Hamiltonian vec-\ntors (or equivalently bulk states) in the momentum space and\nfull projective matrices in real space. For Hermitian systems,\nthese two types of data should lead to the same classiﬁca-\ntion due to the bulk-boundary correspondence. However, for\nnon-Hermitian systems the phase transition points might be\nboundary sensitive and the conventional bulk-boundary cor-\nrespondence may not hold. As a result, the choice of input\ndata becomes subtle, especially for these topological phases\nwith NHSE. In particular, in the following discussion we will\nshow that the data set of full projective matrices cannot be em-\nployed for clustering non-Hermitian topological phases with\nNHSE via the diffusion map method.\nFor simplicity and concreteness, we consider spinless non-\nHermitian topological models with both periodic and open\nboundary conditions (abbreviated as PBC and OBC, respec-\ntively). To apply the ﬁrst-order perturbation theory, here we\nonly focus on the lattice models with discrete eigenvalues.\nWe start with a general two-band model with PBC in the\nmomentum space: ˆH = ⃗d·⃗σ = dxσx+dyσy+dzσz, where\nσx,y,z denotes the usual Pauli matrices and dx,y,z is com-\nplex for non-Hermitian systems.\nAs discussed in previous\npapers [93–95], we may choose the input data sample to be\nx(l) = {ˆd(l)(⃗k)|⃗k ∈BZ} with ˆd =\n⃗d\n√\nd2x+d2y+d2z and BZ de-\nnoting the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. By varying the model parame-\nters ⃗t = (t1, t2, ...) contained implicitly in ˆd, one obtains the\ninput data set {x(l)}. We now analyze how the diffusion map\nmethod can classify these samples into different categories.\nFrom the deﬁnition of the one-step diffusion probability, it\nis clear that the dominant terms are these corresponding to\nthe nearest samples labeled by (l, l+δl) [109]. By adjust-\ning the hyper parameter ϵ, one can show that the connectivity\nbetween x(l) and x(l+δl) depends on the derivability of the\nunit vector ˆd(l) = ⃗d(l)/E(l)\n+ on ⃗t for all ki ∈[−π, π], where\nE(l)\n+ =\nq\nd2x+d2y+d2z. The gap closure points E(l)\n± = 0 typi-\ncally break the derivability. Hence, two samples (l, l+δl) sep-\narated by the gap closure point should result in Kl,l+δl ≈0,\ni.e. vanishing one-step diffusion probability between them.\nCombined with the approximation that only the nearest sam-\nples dominantly contribute to the diffusion, the gap closure\npoints divide the kernel matrix into blocks, and samples cor-\nresponding the same block are connected via diffusion, hence\nbelonging to the same topological phase. Thus for those mod-\nels with phase transition occurring at the gap closure points,\nthe data samples in the same phase should be clustered into\nthe same category via the diffusion map.\nWith OBC, things become tricky due to the possible ex-\nistence of the NHSE. In this case, a straightforward choice\nfor the input data would be the projective matrices deﬁned as\nP = P\nRe[Em]<0 |mR⟩⟨mL| [43], where |mR⟩and ⟨mL| are\nthe right and left eigenstates (with the corresponding eigenen-\nergy Em and E∗\nm respectively) of the non-Hermitian Hamil-\ntonian in real space. We mention that P can be used to deﬁne\nthe topological invariants for non-Hermitian systems in real\nspace [43]. The L1-norm of a matrix is deﬁned by ∥P∥L1 =\nP\ni,j |Pij|.\nAs was mentioned above, the nearest samples\ndominantly contribute to the diffusion probability with proper\nhyper parameter ϵ. Then the Gaussian kernel can be expressed\nas Kl,l+δl = exp\n\u0012\n−\n∥δP ∥2\nL1\n2ϵN 2\n\u0013\n= exp\n\u0010\n−\n(∥∇⃗tP ∥L1·δ⃗t )2\n2ϵN 2\n\u0011\n.\nThe singularity of ∥∇⃗tP∥L1 is crucial to the kernel values.\nFor convenient illustration, let us take the one-dimensional\n(1D) non-Hermitian SSH model with OBC (in Fig.\n1) as\nan example, where the fermion annihilation (creation) opera-\ntors on the A and B sublattices are denoted by CA (C†\nA) and\nCB (C†\nB), respectively; t1, t2, and γ are model parameters\ncharacterizing the hopping strength. A sketch of the phase\ndiagram is shown in Fig. 1. We consider the parameter re-\ngion t1 > |γ|, where the non-Hermitian SSH Hamiltonian\nˆH1D\no\nin orthonormal bases can be transformed into a Her-\n3\nmitian matrix ¯H1D\no\nin non-orthonormal bases [41]: ¯H1D\no\n=\nΓ−1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ with Γ = diag(1, r, r, r2, r2, · · · , rN−1, rN), and\nr =\np\n|(t1−γ)/(t1+γ)|. Then ∂t1P reduces to [110]:\n∂t1P =\nX\nRe[Em]<0\nn̸=m\n⟨n|Γ∂t1 ˆHΓ−1|m⟩Γ−1|n⟩⟨m|Γ+ (n ↔m)\nEm−En\n.\nDirect\ncalculations\nshow\nthat\nall\nterms\n⟨n|Γ∂t1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ−1|m⟩/N\nare ﬁnite [110].\nSuppose the\nsystem is initially in the topologically trivial phase, then\nwhen the system approaches the phase transition point\n|t1| =\np\nt2\n2+γ2, the two levels E±1 approach zero and\nbecome the zero modes, which will be eliminated in the\nP-matrix after passing through the transition point. The only\nsingularity (|t1| ̸= |γ|) of 1/(Em−En) occurs at the gap\nclosing point, where the two nearest levels |E−1−E1| →0.\nSo far, everything looks similar to the Hermitian SSH model.\nHowever, the term Γ−1|n⟩⟨m|Γ, which basically gives rise to\nthe NHSE, involves matrix elements with values r±(i−j+1)\nthat are singular when |i−j| →∞. This singularity is bound-\nary condition sensitive and unique to non-Hermitian systems.\nIt persists for a wide range of parameter space, independent\nof the phase transitions. As a consequence, it will render the\ndiffusion map method invalid and should be removed from\nthe input data. To address this problem, we propose to use\nthe “on-site” part of the P-matrix elements as the raw input\ndata: {PiA,iB|i ∈[1, N]}, where r±(i−j+1) factors cancel\nout and no singularity shows up. Such “on-site” extraction\nshould be suitable to those non-Hermitian models where the\nNHSE exhibits an exponential function of lattice site. With\nthis adjusted P-matrix as the input data, the kernel values\nKl,l+δl ≈1 for all the data samples from the same phase,\nbut two samples {l, l+δl} crossing the phase transition point\nhave no connectivity Kl,l+δl ≈0. This restores the capability\nof the diffusion map method in classifying non-Hermitian\ntopological phases with NHSE in the unsupervised fashion.\nThe above discussion explains in theory why and when\nthe diffusion map method can be applied to classify non-\nHermitian topological phases, and how to overcome the ob-\nstacles due to the NHSE. To illustrate how this method works\nin practice, in the following we apply it to a couple of concrete\nexamples, including the cases with and without the NHSE.\nUnsupervised learning without NHSE.—The ﬁrst example\nwe consider is the non-Hermitian SSH model with PBC. In\nthe momentum space, this model reads Hp(k) = ⃗d·⃗σ =\n(t1+t2 cos k)σx+(t2 sin k+iγ)σy. The input data set can be\nchosen as {x(l)|x(l) = {ˆd(ki), |ki = 2i−N−2\nN\nπ, i ∈[1, N]}}\nwith varying t1, while ﬁxing t2 and γ. Our numerical results\nare shown in Fig. 2 (a-c). From Fig. 2 (a), the kernel matrix K\nis separated into three blocks, which correspond to the three\nlargest eigenvalues λ0,1,2 ≈1 of the one-step diffusion ma-\ntrix P, as shown in Fig. 2 (b). As a result, the input samples\nare classiﬁed into three different topological phases. This is\nalso clearly indicated in Fig. 2 (c), where we show the scat-\nter diagram of eigenvectors {ψ1, ψ2} corresponding to λ1,2.\n(a)\n(c)\n(b)\n!!\n\" < !# −$\n!# −$ < !!\n\" < !# + $\n!!\n\" > !# + $\n(d)\n1\n0\n2\n3\n0.1\n0\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.06\n0.1\n0.2\n4%\n5\n4%\n5\nFIG. 2.

(d) For the QWZ\nmodel, the input samples are classiﬁed into seven categories [110].\nIn addition, the phase boundaries can also be obtained from\nFig. 2 (a), which match exactly with the theoretical one [110].\nAnother example we consider is the 2D non-Hermitian\nQWZ model with PBC: ˆH2D\np (k) = (vx sin kx+iγx)σx+\n(vy sin ky+iγy)σy+(M−0.5 cos kx−0.5 cos ky)σz.\nThe\nphase boundaries occur at M (ν)\n±\n= (2−ν)±\nq\nγ2x+γ2y, ν =\n1, 2, 3. The Hamiltonian in the region M ∈(−∞, M (3)\n−)∪\n(M (3)\n+ , M (2)\n−)∪(M (2)\n+ , M (1)\n−)∪(M (1)\n+ , +∞) is gapped and the\ntopological Chern number is well-deﬁned. However, in re-\ngions M ∈(M (ν)\n−, M (ν)\n+ ) the Hamiltonian is gapless and the\ntopological indices are not well-deﬁned. These gapless re-\ngions lead to singularities and hence no diffusion probability\namong samples from such regions. Nevertheless, one can still\nutilize the diffusion map method to locate the phase bound-\naries M (1,2,3)\n±\nbased on the “effective” kernel matrix, which\nis the average of a set of kernel matrices with different lattice\nsizes (different discrete ⃗k conﬁgurations) as the input data.\nBy such a construction, the diffusion map method still works\neven with input samples in gapless regions. We choose the\nbulk Hamiltonian as the input samples by varying the parame-\nter M and our numerical results are shown in Fig. 2 (d). From\nthis ﬁgure, the samples are classiﬁed into seven categories. In\naddition, careful examinations of the heatmap for the kernel\nmatrix yield that the phase boundaries identiﬁed by the diffu-\nsion map method coincide with the theoretical ones [110].\nUnsupervised learning with NHSE.—The above numerical\nresults show clearly that the diffusion map method is indeed\ncapable of classifying non-Hermitian topological phases with-\nout NHSE. Yet, as discussed in the beginning the presence of\nthe NHSE may handicap the performance of this approach. A\npossible way out of this is to choose different input data.

We still focus on the non-Hermitian SSH\nand QWZ models, but with OBCs this time.\nWe start with the 1D non-Hermitian SSH model [41]. With\nOBC, the phase boundaries are theoretically predicted to be\nt1 = ±\np\nt2\n2+γ2. Topological non-trivial phase with ground\nstate degeneracy occurs in the interval |t1| <\np\nt2\n2+γ2. We\nnumerically diagonalize the real space Hamiltonian ˆH1D\no\nfor\ngiven system sizes and parameters, and choose partial ele-\nments of the projective matrices {P (l)\niA,iB|i ∈[1, N]} as the\nraw input data {x(l)}. Our numerical results are shown in\nFig. S2 (a-c). From this ﬁgure, the input samples are classi-\nﬁed into two categories and the learnt phase transition point\noccurs at t1 ≈0.6993, which is consistent with theoretically\npredicted values of t1 =\np\nt2\n2+γ2 ≈0.7211 [110]. The small\ndiscrepancy is mainly due to the fact that only partial infor-\nmation of the projective matrices are used and the ﬁnite size\neffect in our numerical simulations (see [110] for details).\nFor the 2D non-Hermitian QWZ model with OBC, it has\nbeen shown from both analytical and numerical aspects that\none topological phase boundary occurs approximately at M =\nM0 = tx+ty+ txγ2\nx\n2v2x +\ntyγ2\ny\n2v2y for small\nγx(y)\nvx(y) [42]. When M <\nM0, the corresponding Chern number in generalized Brillouin\nzone for the valence band (Re(E) < 0) is C = 1. Whereas\nfor M > M0, the Chern number is C = 0. With partial\nelements of the projective matrices as input data, the diffu-\nsion map method works as well and our numerical results are\nshown in Fig. S2 (d). It is clear from this ﬁgure that the in-\nput samples are classiﬁed into two distinct categories and the\nlearnt phase boundary occurs at M ≈2.1731, which matches\nthe theoretical value M = 2.2 with a desirable accuracy [110].\nWe mention that non-Hermitian systems are extremely sen-\nsitive to boundary conditions. A change of boundary condi-\ntions could alter drastically both the eigenspectra and eigen-\nstates [111]. This is in sharp contrast to the case of Hermi-\ntian systems. From the unsupervised learning results shown\nabove, it is also clear that different boundary conditions lead\nto completely different clustering results of the input samples.\nFor instance, with PBC the data samples of the QWZ model\nare clustered into seven groups via the diffusion map method,\nwhereas with OBC one obtains only two categories. Owing to\nthe NHSE, the relevant features of input data could be dramat-\nically suppressed and consequently are harder to extract. Here\nwe note that the obstacle induced by the NHSE may also ex-\nist in other machine learning approaches, e.g., the CNN-based\nones [91], and the solution we provide here should carry over\nto these algorithms as well [110]. We also remark that ﬁnd-\ning the appropriate topological invariants based on the pro-\njective matrix is a highly non-trivial task. In fact, a number\nof works have been reported recently in the literature to deal\nwith this problem [30, 39, 43, 112]. Although the diffusion\nmap approach still requires full diagonalization of Hamiltoni-\nans in real space, it does not rely on any a priori information\nabout the underlying topological invariants. As a result, this\napproach is also applicable to non-Hermitian systems whose\ncharacteristic topological invariants have not yet been discov-\nered. In addition, the requirement of the costly diagonaliza-\ntion might be circumvented by replacing the projective matrix\nwith observables (e.g., correlation functions) that can be mea-\nsured in experiment. We leave this interesting and important\nproblem for future studies.\nDiscussion and conclusion.—Symmetries play a crucial\nrole in the study of topological phases and, analogous to\nthe Hermitian case [113], a periodic table for non-Hermitian\nHamiltonians has also been established from the K theory\nperspective recently [29]. Yet, incorporating symmetry con-\nstraints into unsupervised learning approaches to topological\nphases is highly nontrivial [94]. In the future, it would be\ninteresting and desirable to extend our results to symmetry\nprotected or enriched non-Hermitian topological phases, espe-\ncially those predicted in the periodic table. In addition, non-\nHermitian topological phases for interacting systems remain\nelusive and we expect that unsupervised learning will provide\nvaluable wisdom in studying such phases as well.\nIn summary, we have introduced an unsupervised ma-\nchine learning approach to classify non-Hermitian topological\nphases based on diffusion maps. We show that the NHSE can\nresult in a critical handicap for the straightforward extension\nof the unsupervised method of learning Hermitian topological\nphases to the non-Hermitian case. Through theoretical analy-\nsis and numerical simulations, we have demonstrated that this\nobstacle can be avoided by appropriately choosing the input\ndata, such as the “on-site” elements of the projective matri-\nces. Our results reveal a new consequence of the NHSE and\nwould beneﬁt future studies across non-Hermitian topological\n5\nphases and machine learning.\nWe acknowledge Mathias S.

In diffusion map algorithm, two\nsamples far from each other may have considerable diffusion\nprobability with the assistance of symmetry. For details, see\nPRL.124.226401.\n[115] For non-Hermitian topological systems with PBC, there also\nexist gapless phases. For example, the 2D non-Hermitian Qi-\nWu-Zhang(QWZ) model has gapless phases.\n8\nSupplementary Material for: Unsupervised Learning of Non-Hermitian Topological Phases\nDiffusion map is a sort of typical manifold learning algorithm [106–108], which provides non-linear dimensionality reduction\nand unsupervised clustering of raw data without any priori knowledge. It combines the heat diffusion with the random walk\nMarkov chain. Concretely, given a set of input data x = {x(1), x(2), · · · x(L)}, where x(i) represents the i-th data point in\ncomplex space Cd. The connectivity between two points x(l) and x(l′) is described by the local similarity, which is required to\nbe positive deﬁnite and symmetric. For example, the Gaussian kernel\nKl,l′ = exp\n \n−\n∥x(l)−x(l′)∥2\nLp\n2ϵ\n!\n,\n(S1)\nwhere ∥x(l)−x(l′)∥Lp represents the Lp-norm distance between two points x(l) and x(l′), variance ϵ is a small quantity to be\nadjusted. Recently, applications of p = 1, 2, ∞cases in unsupervised clustering topological phases have been reported [93–96].\nWhen p = 2, the distance is the familiar Euclidean distance. With such kernel, the one-step transition matrix P of Markovian\nrandom walk between two points x(l) and x(l′) can be deﬁned as follows\nPl,l′ =\nKl,l′\nP\nl′ Kl,l′ ,\n(S2)\nwhere Pl,l′ obeys the probability conservation condition P\nl Pl,l′ = 1. Then after 2t steps of random walk, the connectivity\nbetween x(l) and x(l′) is given by the diffusion distance\nDt(l, l′) = Dt(x(l), x(l′)) =\nL\nX\nk=1\n\u0010\nPt\nl,k−Pt\nl′,k\n\u00112\nP\nj Kk,j\n=\nL−1\nX\nk=1\nλ2t\nk [(ψk)l−(ψk)l′]2 ≥0,\n(S3)\nwhere {ψk} are the right eigenvectors of P, Pψk = λkψk, k = 0, 1, ...L−1, the corresponding eigenvalues rank in descending\norder, i.e. λ0 = 1 ≥λ1 ≥· · · ≥λL−1. k = 0 term does not contribute because the corresponding right eigenvector is constant\nwith all vector elements equivalent.\nUnder the mapping\nx(l) →Ψ(l)\nt\n:= [λt\n1(ψ1)l, λt\n2(ψ2)l, · · · , λt\nL−1(ψL−1)l],\n(S4)\nthe distance between samples x(l) and x(l′) can be recast as the Euclidean distance in Ψ space\nDt(x(l), x(l′)) = ∥Ψl−Ψl′∥2\nL2.\n(S5)\nAfter t →∞steps, only the ﬁrst few components with largest |λk| ≈1 are dominant due to the term λt\nk in Ψt. Hence almost all\nthe distance information is encoded in such few components. Then the original samples x(l) with higher dimension are reduced\nto the lower ones, and the clustering method (e.g. k-means) can be applied in Ψ space to cluster the corresponding samples with\nno prior knowledge. Speciﬁcally, in clustering the topological phases of quantum models, the number of |λk| ≈1 equals to\nthe number of topological clusters without prior labels. Hence it is possible for such algorithm to detect unknown topological\nphases.\nPHASES OF NON-HERMITIAN TOPOLOGICAL MODELS\n1D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model\nPeriodic boundary condition\nWith periodic boundary condition(PBC), the system obeys translational symmetry, and the bulk Hamiltonian takes the form\nˆH1D\np (k) = ⃗d·σ = dxσx+dyσy\n(S6)\nin the momentum bases {Ck,A, Ck,B}, where Ck,A and Ck,B represent the fermionic sublattice sites, ⃗d = (dx, dy), dx =\nt1+t2 cos k, dy = t2 sin k+iγ. The 1D Brillouin zone is given by [−π, π]. Winding number W =\n1\nπ\nR π\n−π\ndx∂kdy−dy∂kdx\nd2x+d2y\ndk\n9\ncounts the times of the mapping wrapping around the original point. Different winding numbers indicate different topological\nphases of matter:\nW =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0,\n|t1±γ| > |t2|;\n1\n2,\n|t1±γ| < |t2|&|γ| > |t2|;\n1,\n|t1±γ| < |t2|&|γ| < |t2|.\n(S7)\nThe above half-winding number has a geometrical explanation, see Ref. [27] for details. For the non-Hermitian system with\nPBC, the sublattice symmetry [29] S = σz, σz ˆH(1D)\np\n(k)σz = −ˆH(1D)\np\n(k) ensures that the bulk bands are in pairs E±(k) =\n±\np\n(t1+t2 cos k)2+(t2 sin k+iγ)2. The topological phase transition occurs at the exceptional points t1 = −t2±γ (k = 0) and\nt1 = t2±γ (k = π), which coincide with the change of winding numbers.\nOpen boundary condition\nThe 1D non-Hermitian SSH model in the real space takes the following form:\nˆH1D\no\n=\nN\nX\ni=1\n(t1+γ)C†\ni,ACi,B+(t1−γ)C†\ni,BCi,A+t2C†\ni,BCi+1,A+t2C†\ni+1,ACi,B.\n(S8)\nWith OBC, the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence(BBC) breaks down, and the non-Hermitian skin effect arises. The-\noretically, one straightforward method of detecting the topological phase transition is to calculate its ground state degeneracy.\nDirect numerical calculation of Eq. (S8) with a large enough chain length shows that the 2-fold ground state degeneracy holds\nin the interval |t1| <\np\nt2\n2+γ2. Hence the phase transition occurs at t1 = ±\np\nt2\n2+γ2. This phase boundary does no-longer\ncorrespond to the exceptional point in Brillouin zone, but one can reconstruct the generalized BBC based on a similarity trans-\nformation Γ on the Hamiltonian matrix represented in bases {C1,A, C1,B, C2,A, · · · , CN,B}T ,\n¯H1D\no\n= Γ−1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ,\n(S9)\nwhere Γ is a 2N×2N diagonal matrix with the diagonal elements {1, r, r, r2, r2, ..., rN−1, rN−1, rN}, and r\n=\np\n|(t1−γ)/(t1+γ)|. Then the non-Hermitian matrix ˆH1D\no\nis transformed into a Hermitian matrix ¯H1D\no\nby S, with the trade-off\nthat the bases are transformed to be non-orthonormal as {C1,A, r−1C1,B, r−1C2,A, · · · , r−NCN,B}T . When |t1| > |γ|, i.e.\nr is real, the Hermitian ¯H1D\no\nis exactly the SSH matrix. Fourier transformation maps the real space SSH matrix ¯H1D\no\nto the\nmomentum space,\n¯H1D\no\n(k) = (¯t1+t2 cos k)σx+t2 sin kσy,\n¯t1 =\np\n(t1+γ)(t1−γ).\n(S10)\nClearly, the topological phase transition of ¯H1D\no\n(k) occurs at |¯t1| = |t2|, i.e. t1 = ±\np\nt2\n2+γ2, with the change of topological\nwinding numbers. Hence to discuss the BBC for such non-Hermitian model, one approach is to transform it into the Hermitian\nmatrix formalism under the similarity transformation.\nAnother equivalent approach to deﬁne the non-Hermitian BBC is to introduce the concept of generalized Brillouin zone\nH(eik →β), which transforms the Bloch phase factor eik into |β| ̸= 1 for the non-Hermitian case,\neik := β =\nrt1−γ\nt1+γ eiq,\nq ∈R.\n(S11)\nUnder such transformation, the matrix form of H′(β) in generalized Brillouin zone is exactly the same as Eq. (S10). Then the\ngeneralized BBC holds.\n2D non-Hermitian Qi-Wu-Zhang model\nPeriodic boundary condition\nThe non-Hermitian Qi-Wu-Zhang (QWZ) model takes the following form[42],\nˆH2D =[\nX\ny\nX\nj=x,y\nc†\ny(−i\n2vjσj−1\n2tjσz)cy+ej+h.c.]+\nX\ny\nc†\ny(Mσz+i\nX\nj=x,y,z\nγjσj)cy,\n(S12)\n10\nwhere cy = (cy,A, cy,B)T represents the unit cell fermionic annihilation operator, y labels the 2D lattice number of the unit cell,\nand ej is the unit vector in j = x, y directions. Here we also consider two types of boundary conditions: PBC and OBC.\nWith PBC, the non-Hermitian QWZ model in Eq. (S12) is Fourier transformed into the bulk Hamiltonian in Brillouin zone,\nHp(k) =⃗d·⃗σ = dxσx+dyσy+dzσz\n=(vx sin kx+iγx)σx+(vy sin ky+iγy)σy\n+(M−tx cos kx−ty cos ky+iγz)σz.\n(S13)\nFor simplicity, let γz = 0, tx = ty = 0.5, then the theoretical phase transition boundaries are\nM (1)\n±\n= 1±\nq\nγ2x+γ2y\n(kx, ky) = (0, 0),\nM (2)\n±\n= ±\nq\nγ2x+γ2y\n(kx, ky) = (0, π), (π, 0),\nM (3)\n±\n= −1±\nq\nγ2x+γ2y\n(kx, ky) = (π, π),\n(S14)\nOne unique feature of such model is that in regions M ∈(M (ν)\n−, M (ν)\n+ ) for ν = 1, 2, 3 the Hamiltonian is gapless and the\ntopological indices are not well-deﬁned in these regions.\nOpen boundary condition\nWith OBC, the conventional BBC breaks down. We have to consider the inﬂuence of non-Hermitian skin effect. In OBC\n(independent of the geometrical conﬁguration, such as square or disk, etc. [42]), it has been shown from both the analytical and\nnumerical aspects that one topological phase boundary is approximately expressed as\nM = tx+ty+txγ2\nx\n2v2x\n+tyγ2\ny\n2v2y\n(S15)\nfor small\nγx(y)\nvx(y) . When M < tx+ty+ txγ2\nx\n2v2x +\ntyγ2\ny\n2v2y , the corresponding Chern number in generalized Brillouin zone for the valence\nband (Re(E) < 0) is C = 1. While for M > tx+ty+ txγ2\nx\n2v2x +\ntyγ2\ny\n2v2y , the topological index is C = 0. Hence the boundary separates\nthe system into two distinct topological regions. For more details, see Ref. [42].\nTHE APPLICABILITY OF DIFFUSION MAP IN NON-HERMITIAN TOPOLOGICAL PHASE TRANSITION\nHere we theoretically analyze the applicability of diffusion map in classifying the non-Hermitian topological phases.\nPeriodic boundary condition\nWith PBC, the 2-level topological band model reads\nˆH = ⃗d·σ = dxσx+dyσy+dzσz\n(S16)\nwith the free fermionic bases {Ck,A, Ck,B}, where {dx, dy, dz} can be complex for the non-Hermitian model, the corresponding\nenergy levels E± = ±\nq\nd2x+d2y+d2z. Then the Hamiltonian are equivalently described by the vector ⃗d in Pauli space. In the\nd-dimensional lattice model, the momentum vectors k are discrete in Brillouin zone [−π, π]d. To apply the diffusion map\nalgorithm to such models, the vectors ˆd =\n⃗d\n√\nd2\nx+d2\ny+d2\nz are chosen as the raw data, e.g. for the 1D model with length N, the\ndata sample x(l) = {ˆd(ki), |ki = 2i−N−2\nN\nπ, i ∈[1, N]}. By varying the parameters ⃗t = (t1, t2, ...) in ˆd, one obtains the data\nset {x(l)}.\nIn our diffusion map algorithm, the diffusion probability Pl,l′ =\nKl,l′\nP\nl′ Kl,l′ between samples x(l) and x(l′) is deﬁned by\nchoosing the Gaussian kernel function with the L1-norm\nKl,l′ = exp\n \n−∥x(l)−x(l′)∥2\nL1\n2ϵN 2\n!\n,\n(S17)\n11\nwhere the variance is controlled by 0 < ϵ ≪1.\nImportantly, without the assistance of symmetric operators [114], it is easy to ﬁnd that the prominent contributions of the\none-step diffusion probability Pl,l′ are from those nearest samples l′ = l+δl, i.e. the corresponding parameters ⃗t ′ = ⃗t+δ⃗t, then\nthe L1-norm distance between l and l+δl can be approximately recast to\n∥x(l)−x(l+δl)∥L1 =\nN\nX\ni=1\nX\nα=x,y,z\n\u0010\n∥ˆd(l)\nα (ki)−ˆd(l+δl)\nα\n(ki)∥L1\n\u0011\n≈\nN\nX\ni=1\nX\nα=x,y,z\n\u0010\n∥∇⃗t ( ˆd(l)\nα (ki))∥L1\n\u0011\n·δ⃗t.\n(S18)\nThen the Gaussian kernel Kl,l+δl reads\nKl,l+δl ≈exp\n\n\n−\n\u0010PN\ni=1\nP\nα=x,y,z\n\u0010\n∥∇⃗t ( ˆd(l)\nα (ki))∥L1\n\u0011\n·δ⃗t\n\u00112\n2ϵN 2\n\n\n.\n(S19)\nIn case of confusion, we note that ∥∇⃗t ˆd∥L1 =\n\u0010\n∥∂t1 ˆd∥L1, ∥∂t2 ˆd∥L1, . . . ∥∂tn ˆd∥L1\n\u0011\n.\nAs long as PN\ni=1\n\u0010\n|∇⃗t ( ˆd(l)\nx (ki))|+|∇⃗t ( ˆd(l)\ny (ki))|+|∇⃗t ( ˆd(l)\nz (ki))|\n\u0011\nis ﬁnite, the constant δ⃗t\n2/ϵ can always be adjusted so as\nto keep Kl,l+δl ≈1. Hence the connectivity between l and l′ depends on the derivability of the vector ˆd(l) =\n⃗d\n√\nd2x+d2y+d2z = d(l)\nE(l)\n+\non ⃗t for all ki ∈[−π, π]. The gap closure points E(l)\n± = 0 usually break the constraint. Hence two nearest data samples divided\nby the gap closure point should have Kl,l′ ≈0, i.e. no one-step diffusion probability between such samples. Combined with the\napproximation that only the nearest samples prominently contribute to the diffusion, as a consequence, the gap closure points\ndivide the diffusion matrix into blocks. In most cases, different blocks usually correspond to different topological phases both\nfor Hermitian and non-Hermitian cases [115].\nExample: 1D non-Hermitian SSH model with PBC.– For illustration, we focus on the 1D non-Hermitian SSH model with\nPBC\nHp(k) = ⃗d·⃗σ = dxσx+dyσy,\ndx = t1+t2 cos k, dy = t2 sin k+iγ.\n(S20)\nThe data set {x(l)|x(l) = {ˆd(ki), |ki = 2i−N−2\nN\nπ, i ∈[1, N]}} for clustering is obtained by varying only one parameter t1,\nwhile ﬁxing t2 and the non-Hermitian term γ. Correspondingly, the L1-norm term in Eq. (S18) reads\n∥x(l)−x(l+δl)∥L1\nδt1\n≈\nN\nX\ni=1\n\u0010\n|∂t1 ( ˆd(l)\nx (ki))|+|∂t1 ( ˆd(l)\ny (ki))|\n\u0011\n=\nN\nX\ni=1\n\n\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\nd(l)\ny\n2\nE(l)\n+\n3\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\nki\n+\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\nd(l)\nx d(l)\ny\nE(l)\n+\n3\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\nki\n\n.\n(S21)\nIt is easy to verify that Eq. (S21) tends to be inﬁnite at the gap closure points E± = 0, i.e. the critical cases t1 = t2±γ (ki = −π)\nand t1 = −t2±γ (ki = 0). Hence the kernel value Kl,l+δl ≈0 around such points and the kernel matrix becomes block diagonal.\nAs a consequence, the diffusion map algorithm successfully classiﬁes the topological phases of the 1Dnon-Hermitian SSH model\nwith PBC.\nOpen boundary condition\nHere we show how to apply the diffusion map method to classify phases of non-Hermitian topological models with OBC.\nFor the case of OBC, the raw data is no longer the Hamiltonian vector in momentum space. Instead, we choose the real space\nprojective matrix elements as the raw data. Generally, a projective matrix of such topological model is deﬁned as\nP =\nX\nRe[Em]<0\n|mR⟩⟨mL|,\n(S22)\nwhere |mR⟩and ⟨mL| are the right and left eigenstates of the non-Hermitian model, m covers the continuum bulk spectrum\nleaving out the discrete zero modes.\nWe reiterate that the diffusion between the nearest samples contributes prominently. To illustrate the applicability of the\ndiffusion map method in clustering real space data samples, we consider the projective matrix P (l+δl) = P(⃗t (l+δl)) in ﬁrst-\norder perturbation\nP (l+δl) =\nX\nRe[Em]<0\n|m′\nR⟩⟨m′\nL| ≈\nX\nRe[Em]<0\n\n|mR⟩+\nX\nn̸=m\n⟨nL|δ ˆH|mR⟩\nEm−En\n|nR⟩\n\n\n\n⟨mL|+\nX\nn̸=m\n⟨mL|δ ˆH|nR⟩\nEm−En\n⟨nL|\n\n,\n(S23)\n12\nwhere δ ˆH = ˆH(l+δl)−ˆH(l) and then\nδP = P (l+δl)−P (l) =\nX\nRe[Em]<0\n(|m′\nR⟩⟨m′\nL|−|mR⟩⟨mL|) ≈\nX\nRe[Em]<0\nn̸=m\n \n⟨nL|δ ˆH|mR⟩\nEm−En\n|nR⟩⟨mL|+⟨mL|δ ˆH|nR⟩\nEm−En\n|mR⟩⟨nL|\n!\n.\n(S24)\nHence the Gaussian kernel can be reexpressed as\nKl,l+δl = exp\n \n−∥P (l)−P (l+δl)∥2\nL1\n2ϵN 2\n!\n= exp\n \n−∥δP∥2\nL1\n2ϵN 2\n!\n= exp\n\u0012\n−(∥∇⃗tP∥L1·δ⃗t )2\n2ϵN 2\n\u0013\n,\n(S25)\nwhere ∥∇⃗t P∥L1 = (∥∂t1P∥L1, ∥∂t2P∥L1, . . . ∥∂tnP∥L1). The singularity of ∥∇⃗tP∥L1 is crucial to the kernel values.\nExample: 1D non-Hermitian SSH model with OBC.– Now we take the 1D non-Hermitian SSH model in Eq. (S8)) as an\nexample. The data set {x(l)} is obtained by varying t1. It is well known that the non-Hermitian SSH matrix ˆH1D\no\nin the\northonormal bases can be transformed into a Hermitian SSH matrix ¯H1D\no\nin the non-orthonormal bases for |t1| > |γ|,\n¯H1D\no\n= Γ−1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ,\nΓ−1|n⟩= |nR⟩,\n⟨n|Γ = ⟨nL|,\n¯H1D\no\n|n⟩= En|n⟩.\n(S26)\nwhere Γ = Diag(1, r, r, r2, r2, · · · , rN−1, rN), r =\np\n|(t1−γ)/(t1+γ)|. Then the term ∥∇⃗tP∥L1 can be expressed as\n∥∇⃗tP∥L1 = ∥∂t1P∥L1 =\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\nX\nRe[Em]<0\nn̸=m\n \n⟨nL|∂t1 ˆH1D\no\n|mR⟩\nEm−En\n|nR⟩⟨mL|+⟨mL|∂t1 ˆH1D\no\n|nR⟩\nEm−En\n|mR⟩⟨nL|\n!\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\nL1\n=\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\nX\nRe[Em]<0\nn̸=m\n \n⟨n|Γ∂t1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ−1|m⟩\nEm−En\nΓ−1|n⟩⟨m|Γ+⟨m|Γ∂t1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ−1|n⟩\nEm−En\nΓ−1|m⟩⟨n|Γ\n!\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\nL1\n.\n(S27)\nHere for convenience, we calculate the L1-norm in the fermionic bases {C1,A, C1,B, C2,A, ..., CN,B} instead of the eigenstate\nbases {|n⟩} of ¯H. Similar to the Hermitian SSH model, the singularity of ∥∇⃗tP∥L1 still occurs in condition |E−1−E1| →\n0, which corresponds to the phase transition points |t1| =\np\nt2\n2+γ2. In the next section, we show in detail that the terms\n⟨1|Γ∂t1 ˆ\nHΓ−1|−1⟩\nE−1−E1\nand ⟨−1|Γ∂t1 ˆ\nHΓ−1|1⟩\nE−1−E1\nare both inﬁnite, while all other associated parameters are ﬁnite. Here to remove the\npossible exponential inﬁnity of NHSE, we choose part of the P-matrix elements as the raw input data: {PiA,iB|i ∈[1, N]},\ni.e. the parameters of C†\ni,BCi,A-terms in Γ−1|−1⟩⟨1|Γ and Γ−1|1⟩⟨−1|Γ are ﬁnite numbers ±r. Hence for each matrix element\nPiA,iB, the value of the L1-norm tends to be inﬁnite near the phase transition points |t1| =\np\nt2\n2+γ2. As a consequence, the\ncorresponding Gaussian kernel value tends to be zero, and there is not diffusion probability between the two samples in different\nphases. It indicates the applicability of the diffusion map algorithm in non-Hermitian model with OBC.\nDETAILED CALCULATIONS OF ⟨n|Γ∂t1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ−1|m⟩/N IN 1D NON-HERMITIAN SSH MODEL\nTo manifest that the only singularity originates from the gap closure, we need to show that the term ⟨n|Γ∂t1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ−1|m⟩/N\nis ﬁnite for all bulk eigenstates {|n⟩} of the 1D non-Hermitian SSH model(|t1| > |γ|) with OBC in Eq. (S8).\nIn single fermion system, the eigenstate |n⟩can be expressed as |n⟩= P\ni\n\u0010\nuA\nniC†\ni,A+uB\nniC†\ni,B\n\u0011\n|Vac⟩, P\ni\n\u0000|uA\nni|2+|uB\nni|2\u0001\n=\n1. Then the term ⟨n|Γ∂t1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ−1|m⟩/N takes the form\n1\nN ⟨n|Γ∂t1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ−1|m⟩= 1\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\n⟨n|(rC†\ni,ACi,B+r−1C†\ni,BCi,A)|m⟩,\n= 1\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\nr(uA\nni)∗uB\nmi+r−1(uB\nni)∗uA\nmi\n(S28)\n13\nwhich is of order r±1. Hence the term ⟨n|Γ∂t1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ−1|m⟩/N is ﬁnite for ﬁnite r.\nThen we focus on the singularity of the term ⟨−1|Γ∂t1 ˆ\nH1D\no\nΓ−1|1⟩Γ−1|−1⟩⟨1|Γ+⟨1|Γ∂t1 ˆ\nH1D\no\nΓ−1|−1⟩Γ−1|1⟩⟨−1|Γ\nN(E−1−E1)\n. Let the system\nbe initially in topological trivial phase. Without loss of generality, we suppose the chain length N is large enough, and the\nlowest excitation (annihilation) energy E1(E−1) of ¯H1D\no\nwith OBC is almost equivalent to that of ¯H1D\no\n(k) with PBC, and the\ncorresponding eigenstates can be approximately expressed by\n|±1⟩≈¯C†\nk0,A(B)|Vac⟩\nfor large N, where k0 corresponds to the lowest excitation momentum of ¯H1D\no\n(k) with PBC in Eq. (S10). By diagonalizing\n¯H1D\no\nwith Fourier transformation in the momentum bases {C†\nk,A, C†\nk,B}, one obtains\n¯Hk =\nπ\nX\nk=−π\nEk ¯C†\nk,A ¯Ck,A−Ek ¯C†\nk,B ¯Ck,B,\nC†\nk,A(B) =\n1\n√\nN\nN\nX\nj=1\ne−ikjC†\nj,A(B),\n(S29)\nwhere ¯C†\nk,A =\n1\n√\n2(ξkC†\nk,A+C†\nk,B) and ¯C†\nk,B =\n1\n√\n2(−ξ∗\nkC†\nk,A+C†\nk,B) are the fermionic quasiparticle operators, ξk =\np\n(¯t1+t2e−ik)/(¯t1+t2eik) is just a phase for real ¯t1 in Eq. (S10).\nWe ﬁrst estimate the value of the term ⟨−1|Γ∂t1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ−1|1⟩/N,\n1\nN ⟨−1|Γ∂t1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ−1|1⟩\n= 1\n2N\nπ\nX\nk=−π\n⟨Vac| ¯Ck0,B\n\u0012\n( r\nξk\n+ξk\nr )( ¯C†\nk,A ¯Ck,A−¯C†\nk,B ¯Ck,B)+( r\nξk\n−ξk\nr )( ¯C†\nk,A ¯Ck,B−¯C†\nk,B ¯Ck,A)\n\u0013\n¯C†\nk0,A|Vac⟩\n= 1\n2N (ξk0\nr −r\nξk0\n).\n(S30)\nCorrespondingly, the term ⟨1|Γ∂t1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ−1|−1⟩/N =\n1\n2N ( r\nξk0 −\nξk0\nr ).\nThen we analyze the singularity of the term Γ−1|−1⟩⟨1|Γ. Recalling the deﬁnition of the L1-norm for the matrix ∥P∥L1 =\nP\ni,j |Pij|, here we choose the fermionic bases in real space {C1,A, C1,B, C2,A, ..., CN,B}. The term can be expressed as\nΓ−1|−1⟩⟨1|Γ = Γ−1 ¯C†\nk0,B|Vac⟩⟨Vac| ¯Ck0,AΓ = 1\n2Γ−1(−ξ∗\nk0C†\nk0,A+C†\nk0,B)|Vac⟩⟨Vac|(ξ∗\nk0Ck0,A+Ck0,B)Γ.\n(S31)\nIt is easy to ﬁnd that in the fermionic bases, Γ-matrix would contribute the exponential inﬁnite term ∼rN, hence we choose\nthe element set {C†\ni,A|Vac⟩⟨Vac|Ci,B|i ∈[1, N]} as the raw data instead of the full projective matrix P to overcome the\nobstacle. In Γ−1|−1⟩⟨1|Γ, the term C†\ni,A|Vac⟩⟨Vac|Ci,B has parameter −\nξ∗\nk0r\n2N , while in Γ−1|1⟩⟨−1|Γ, the C†\ni,A|Vac⟩⟨Vac|Ci,B\nhas parameter\nξk0r\n2N . Thus for each matrix element C†\ni,A|Vac⟩⟨Vac|Ci,B, the total parameter contributed from the two energy\nlevels E±1 is\n⟨−1|Γ∂t1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ−1|1⟩Γ−1|−1⟩⟨1|Γ+⟨1|Γ∂t1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ−1|−1⟩Γ−1|1⟩⟨−1|Γ\nN(E−1−E1)\n\f\f\f\f\f\nC†\ni,A|Vac⟩⟨Vac|Ci,B\n=−\nξ∗\nk0r\n2N ⟨−1|Γ∂t1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ−1|1⟩+\nξk0r\n2N ⟨1|Γ∂t1 ˆH1D\no\nΓ−1|−1⟩\nN(E−1−E1)\n=\n−\nξ∗\nk0r\n2N\n1\n2N (\nξk0\nr −r\nξk0 )−\nξk0r\n2N\n1\n2N (\nξk0\nr −r\nξk0 )\nN(E−1−E1)\n=\nr(ξk0+ξ∗\nk0)\n4N 3(E−1−E1)( r\nξk0\n−ξk0\nr ).\n(S32)\nThe above term is non-zero when ξk0+ξ∗\nk0 ̸= 0 and\nr\nξk0 −\nξk0\nr\n̸= 0, which is usually satisﬁed by the non-Hermitian case(r ̸= 1).\nEq. (S32) tends to be inﬁnite when the system approximates to the phase boundary ((E−1−E1) →0).\nIn conclusion, by analyzing the singularity of the values on {C†\ni,A|Vac⟩⟨Vac|Ci,B|i ∈[1, N]}, we show that the gap closure\npoint (phase transition point) where E±1 = 0 corresponds to the inﬁnity of the L1-norm term in Gaussian kernel, which leads\nto the zero kernel value as well as the non-diffusion probability. In such sense, the choice of the raw data we have made here is\nreasonable and can be used for classifying the topological phases via the diffusion map method.\n14\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n0.07\n0.14\n0.00\n-0.07\n-0.14\n0.07\n0.14\n0.00\n-0.07\n-0.14\n0.07\n0.14\n0.00\n-0.07\n-0.14\nSample number\nSample number\nSample number\nFIG.

We have the following four cases in total: the 1D non-Hermitian SSH and the 2D non-Hermitian QWZ models with\nPBC and OBC respectively, see Figs. (S1, S2, S3, S5).\nDIFFUSION MAP IN CLASSIFYING PHASES WITH GAPLESS BAND SPECTRA\nIn this work, we have studied the classiﬁcation of the 2D NH QWZ model with PBC based on the diffusion map algorithm.\nTheoretically, for PBC the diffusion map cannot be directly utilized for clustering topological phases with the gapless bulk\nspectra, since the input data ˆd(k) =\n⃗d\n√\n⃗d2 could be singular at the gapless momentum points. The reason has been shown in\nSec. , which demonstrates that the samples with the gapless point (⃗d)2 = 0 lead to the zero diffusion probability, and the kernel\nmatrix is separated into diagonal blocks by such samples. Adding samples at exactly or near the gapless point could result in\nartiﬁcial zero diffusion probability, and consequently lead to more predicted phases than the true number of phases hosted by\n15\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n0.03\n0.06\n0.00\n-0.03\n-0.06\n0.03\n0.06\n0.00\n-0.03\n-0.06\n1.5\n1.8\n2.1\n2.5\n2.8\n1.5 1.8\n2.1\n2.5\n2.8\nSample number\nSample number\nFIG.

(a) Heatmap of the Gaussian\nkernel values. The red arrow indicates the phase transition point. (b, c) Two right eigenvectors ψ0,1 of P with the eigenvalues λ0,1 ≈1, which\nindicate the two different topological phases in non-Hermitian QWZ model in OBC. In (b, c), the horizontal axis denotes the sample number,\nand the vertical axis denotes the coefﬁcients of each sample site in eigenvectors. Each sample x(l) with N = 576 features can be mapped to\nthe reduced two dimensional feature space ((ψ0)l, (ψ1)l). With such two eigenvectors, the 450 samples {x(l)} with varying M are clustered\ninto two parts around two points: (0.0471, 0.0348) with 215 samples and (0.0471, -0.0560) with 235 samples. Each part corresponds to one\ntopological phase.\nthe system.\nWe ﬁrst introduce how to identify the artiﬁcial phase boundaries owing to the samples with the gapless spectra. Given the\nparameter region of a Bloch Hamiltonian, one can obtain different sample sets by choosing different lattice sizes. Although\ndifferent lattice size leads to the different feature dimension of an input sample, the matrix dimensions of kernels for different\nlattice sizes are the same due to that the number of samples in each set are the same. The mechanism for detection is simple: If\nthe gapless bulk spectrums only occur at the phase boundaries (usually with the gapless spectra at the momentum 0 or π), then\nthe block boundaries of the kernel matrices should be same for different lattice sizes, hence the diffusion map approach applies\ndirectly. While there exist phases with gapless spectra, like the 2D NH QWZ model, the appearance of momenta for the gapless\nbulk spectra would depend on the choice of lattice sizes (note that for different lattice sizes, the discrete momentum points are\ndifferent after the Fourier transformation), i.e., whether the momenta for gapless bulk spectra is in the discrete momentum set.\nHence the blocks of the corresponding kernel matrices may change with the varying lattice sizes, then the failure of the machine\nlearning method can be detected by directly comparing the classiﬁcation results in different lattice sizes. At the phase transition\npoint, the gapless momentum k0 is usually 0 or π, whose appearance in discrete momentum conﬁguration is independent of the\nlattice sizes. Those invariant block boundaries with varying lattice sizes are the real phase boundaries. We take the 2D NH QWZ\nmodel as an example, detailed numerical calculations in Fig. S4 show that the artiﬁcial phases boundaries appear owing to the\nsamples with the gapless momenta within the gapless phases region.\nTo circumvent the above obstacle, one can construct an “effective” Gaussian kernel matrix by simply averaging the kernel\nmatrices of different input sample sets with varying lattice sizes (different discrete momentum conﬁgurations), so that the\nartiﬁcial zero diffusion probabilities become nonzero after the average. The example of the 2D NH QWZ model is shown\nin Fig.S5.\nDISCREPANCY OF THE DIFFUSION MAP ALGORITHM IN PREDICTING PHASE BOUNDARIES\nIn locating the phase boundaries of models with PBC, the diffusion map algorithm performs high accuracy, i.e., the discrep-\nancy between the learned phase boundaries and the theoretical ones is very small. In the case of OBC, the phase boundaries\npredicted by the unsupervised method behave ∼1% discrepancy. We conclude that the following reasons lead to the discrepancy.\n1) One prominent reason for the discrepancy should be the ﬁnite size of the model we study here. The numerical calculated\nphase boundary approximates to the theoretical one when the size tends to be inﬁnite. We carry out numerical calculations\nto support this point. For the 1D NH SSH model with OBC, we numerically obtain the input data with different model\nsizes for the diffusion map algorithm. We choose the same parameters as in the main manuscript with the theoretical\nphase transition point 0.7211. We obtain that when the number of unit cells N=60, the learned phase transition point\nis 0.6862; When N=80, the learned phase transition point is 0.6993; When N=100, the learned phase transition point is\n0.7058. Fig. S6 demonstrates that with the model size increasing, the discrepancy between the learned phase transition\npoint and the theoretical prediction tends to be smaller.\n16\n-0.6\n0.7\n1.9\n-1.9\n-0.6\n0.7\n1.9\n-1.9\n0.02\n0.00\n-0.02\n-0.04\n-0.06\n0\n400\n800\n1200\n𝜓!\nSample number\n(a)\n(b)\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n0\n400\n800\n1200\n𝜓\"\nSample number\n(c)\n1.0\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.8\nFIG.

(a) Heatmap of the Gaussian kernel values. It is obvious that there are more than seven\nblocks, which is beyond the theoretical predicted clusters of phases.

For example, in the 1D\nNH SSH model with N unit cells, to circumvent the obstacle of NHSE, we just choose a small part, i.e., N out of 4N 2\nprojective matrix elements for each sample as the input data. This can be regarded as a trade-off between the compression\nof features and the training precision. The similar trade-off also exists in another work [92] of the CNN-based supervised\nlearning topological phases based on the experimental data. In that work, the authors showed that the trained CNN could\nsuccessfully identify (with a probability > 90%) different topological phases with less than 10% of the experimental data.\n3) In addition, for the 2D NH QWZ model with OBC, the theoretical predicted phase boundary itself is an approximation,\nwhich is based on the perturbation theory. In the original paper of the 2D NH QWZ model [42], there already exists\ndiscrepancy (∼0.6% for M ≈2.2) between the theoretical phase transition point and the numerical results.

For the\n2D NH QWZ model with PBC, the samples are obtained by varying the parameter M. Here for completeness, we utilize the\ndiffusion map to classify samples generated by varying other parameters. To circumvent the obstacle posed by the samples\nwith the gapless momenta within the gapless regions, here we choose the “effective” kernel matrix mentioned in Sec. for the\ndiffusion map algorithm.\nFirstly, we discuss the case of varying the parameter tx while ﬁxing other parameters. Without loss of generality, one can set\nvx = vy = 1, γx = 0.6, γy = 0.8, γz = 0, M = 2 and ty = 2. Then from Eq. S13 one can theoretically obtain seven phases,\nwith the theoretical phase boundaries tx = {−5, −3, −1, 1, 3, 5}. Detailed numerical calculations based on the diffusion map\nmethod show that the seven different phases are successfully classiﬁed, see Fig. S7 for details.\nThen we discuss the case of varying the parameter γx and keeping other values ﬁxed. Numerical results show that the phases\nare successfully classiﬁed, see Fig. S8 for details.\nDISCUSSION ABOUT THE OBSTACLE POSED BY NHSE IN MACHINE LEARNING METHODS\nIn this section, we would like to make a discussion about the universality of obstacle owing to NHSE for different machine\nlearning methods. Recently, a number of unsupervised learning methods have been proposed to classify topological phases,\nsuch as clustering, variational autoencoders, divergence-based predictive method, learning by confusion, topological data aug-\nmentation, and so on [93–104]. However, most of these methods are based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and have\nonly been applied to Hermitian systems. For non-Hermitian systems with NHSE, since all the eigenstates are exponentially\nlocalized at the boundaries, the relevant features could be dramatically suppressed and consequently are hard to extract. This\nleads to a notable obstacle owing to the NHSE, independent of which learning algorithm is utilized. In a recent work [91], the\nauthors successfully predicted the topological phases of non-Hermitian SSH model in the momentum space with PBC based on\nthe supervised CNN machine learning method. However, they noted that the CNN algorithm for learning the non-Hermitian\nmodels in the momentum space (with PBC) could not carry over to the non-Hermitian topological phases with the skin effect in\nthe real space (with OBC), and further studies on NHSE and the classiﬁcation of non-Hermitian topological phases with OBCs\nbased on machine learning algorithms would be conducted. The unsupervised methods based on CNN would suffer the same\nobstacle owning to NHSE as for the diffusion map method.\n18\n𝜓!\n(a)\n(h)\n𝜓\"\n(g)\n(f)\n(e)\n𝜓#\n(d)\n(c)\n𝜓$\n(b)\n𝜓%\n0.05\n𝜓&\n𝜓'\n1.0\n0.01\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.00\n0.8\n-0.06\n0\n100\n-0.12\n200 300 400\n0.04\n0.00\n-0.04\n0.05\n0.00\n0.0\n6.9\n-6.9\n-0.10\n0.0\n6.9\n-6.9\nSample number\nSample number\nSample number\n0\nSample number\n100\nSample number\n200\nSample number\n300\nSample number\n400\n0\n100 200 300 400\n0\n100 200 300 400\n0\n100 200 300 400\n0\n100 200 300 400\n0\n100 200 300 400\n1.000\n0.997\nEigenvalues\n0.03\n0.05\n0.00\n-0.10\n0.05\n0.00\n-0.10\n0.05\n0.00\n-0.10\nFIG.
