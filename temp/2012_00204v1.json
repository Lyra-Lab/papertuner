AlexNet won the first prize in the ImageNet competition and the \ntop-5 test error rate is much lower than the second-best entry. After that, deep convolution neural \nnetworks have been widespread concern by researchers, and many more deep models have been \nproposed. Currently, deep convolution neural networks have become the most prevailing method in \ncomputer vision. Simonyan proposed the VGG network, which not only deepens the network depth but \nalso greatly improves the nonlinear expression ability of the network [2]. Szegedy designed the \ninception module in convolution network and propose the inception network models [3-6]. He et al. \nproposed the residual network. The residual network greatly deepens the network layers of the model \nby using the skip connection [7]. Huang et al. proposed the DenseNet model, which establishes the \ndense connection between the front and back network layers, and also greatly deepens the number of \nnetwork layers of the model [8]. From the above convolution network design development process, the \nnetwork structure is getting deeper and deeper. The success of these deep models can be attributed to \nthe improvement of computing power and the tremendous labelled data. However, many computer \nvision tasks lack sufficient labelled data. For example, the ferrograph images used for the wear \ndetection of mechanical equipment in the industry are often insufficient. In this case, the performance \nof deep neural networks will be greatly degradative. Recently, few-shot learning has been proposed to \ntackle this problem [9]. Few-shot learning method can generalize to new tasks with few training \nsamples. Fine-tuning a deep model is a simple and effective few-shot learning method. Yosinski et al. \nmake a detailed study on the transferable portability of AlexNet [10]. However, there are few layers in \nthe AlexNet and the BN (batch normalized) layer [4] used in mainstream networks is not included in \nAlexNet. BN layers enable each layer of the deep network to learn a similar data distribution, which \ncan accelerate model convergence and prevent over-fitting of the model. However, recent studies show \nthat BN layers may be related to the data domain and may not be generalizable to other domain [11]. \nThus, how to deal with BN layers in fine-tuning when the target domain is different from the source \ndomain? \nFerrography is a feasible wear detection technology in the industry. It can directly reflect the fault \ninformation of mechanical equipment in the form of ferrography image [12, 13]. However, the \nacquisition of ferrography image needs much time and manpower. Therefore, the amount of \nferrography image is generally small. One or two ferrograph images can be collected when the fault is \nrare. Recently, fine-tuning methods have been applied to classify ferrograph images [14, 15]. However, \nthese researches lack deep investigation of fine-tuning. Hence, we will carry out a large number of \nexperiments on fine-tuning to explore whether fine-tuning can be used for ferrograph image \nrecognition, and how to design a feasible and effective fine-tuning approach for ferrograph image \nclassification. Specifically, the following problems will be studied in this research: \n(1) Are fine-tuning effective? The data distribution of ferrograph image is quite different from that \nof the ImageNet. Will negative transfer [16] occur?  \n(2) Which fine-tuning approach is effective? Fine-tune all weights or partial parameters? \n(3) Fine-tune what kind of layer? Fine-tune what kind of layer will achieve the best result? \n(4) Are BN layers needed to be fine-tuned? Which BN layers need to be fine-tuned? \n(5) Why fine-tuning is effective? \n2 Method \n \nWe collected oil samples form mechanical equipment and made into ferrograph images. There are \nseven types of ferrograph images, namely background image, fatigue wear particle image, oxidized \nwear particle image, spherical wear particle image, fatigue wear particle and oxide wear particle image, \nfatigue wear particle and spherical wear particle image, and oxidation wear particle and spherical wear \nparticle image in this study. We randomly selected 909 images as the training set and 881 images as the \ntest set. Besides, 20 and 40 samples for each class are randomly sampled from the training set to obtain \ntwo other small data sets. The subsequent experiments in this research will be carried out on these three \ndatasets. The training data set with 909 images is called FI909, FI140 and FI280 are extrapolated in this \nway. \n \nSimilar to [11] [17], we designed a metric based on KL divergence to analyze the difference of the \nweights of different fine-tuning models. We assume the weights in the deep models follow a Gaussian \ndistribution with mean µ and variance σ2. Then the KL divergence of the weights of two different \nfine-tuning models A and B would be: \n \n2\nA\n2\nA\n2\nA\n2\nA\n2\nB\n2\nB\n(\n)\n2\n(\n)\n2\n2\n2\nA\nA\nA\nB\nB\n(\n)\nA\n2\nB\n2\n2\nB\nA\nA\nB\n2\nA\nB\n1\n2π\n1\n(\n(\n,\n) ||\n(\n,\n))\nlog\nd\n2π\n1\n2π\n(\n)\n                                           \nlog\n2\nx\nx\nx\nx\ne\nKL N\nN\ne\nx\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      (1) \n3 Experiment  \nWe adopt the classical deep models DenseNet121, DenseNet201, ResNet18, ResNet50, and \nResNet152 in this study. \n3.1 Transfer weights and train FC layers \nFirst, we will investigate whether transfer weights from pre-trained deep model and only train the \nFC (Full connected) layers can improve the accuracy of ferrograph image classification. Therefore, we \ncarry out two groups of comparative experiments, namely, training the whole deep models from scratch \nand transfer weights from pre-trained deep models and only train the FC layers. When all models are \ntrained from scratch, we find that the larger learning rate cannot make the models converge. Especially, \ngradient explosion occurs in the very deep models. Therefore, we set the learning rate to 0.001 and \nadopt Adam optimizer. When the weights are transferred and the FC layers are trained, we find the \nlearning rate 0.001 also make the best results. Thus, the learning rate is also set to 0.001 in this case. \nThe experimental results are shown in Table 1-3. \n \nTable 1 Train from scratch VS transfer weights and train FC layers in FI140. \nModels \nTrain from scratch \nTransfer weights and train FC layers \nDenseNet121 \n56.6402 \n58.6833 \nDenseNet201 \n57.8888 \n56.0726 \nResNet18 \n51.0783 \n54.9376 \nResNet50 \n51.0783 \n59.0238 \nResNet152 \n50.5108 \n61.521 \n \nTable 2 Train from scratch VS transfer weights and train FC layers in FI280. \nModels \nTrain from scratch \nTransfer weights and train FC layers \nDenseNet121 \n70.1476 \n62.4291 \nDenseNet201 \n70.1476 \n63.4506 \nResNet18 \n59.2509 \n59.0238 \nResNet50 \n60.4994 \n63.4506 \nResNet152 \n56.6402 \n62.3156 \n \nTable 3 Train from scratch VS transfer weights and train FC layers in FI909. \nModels \nTrain from scratch \nTransfer weights and train FC layers \nDenseNet121 \n86.7196 \n74.5743 \nDenseNet201 \n86.4926 \n77.185 \nResNet18 \n81.3848 \n72.7582 \nResNet50 \n81.8388 \n74.6879 \nResNet152 \n81.7253 \n76.277 \n \n \nAs shown in Table 1-3, when the quantity of the ferrograph image is small, transfer weights and \nonly train the FC layers is effective. However, when the number of the ferrograph image is larger, \ntraining the deep models from scratch obtains better results, which means negative transfer occurs [16]. \nMoreover, we find that training the deep models from scratch can achieve more than 80% accuracy in \nFI909, which shows the classify task is relatively simple.  \n3.2 Fine-tuning CNN layers or BN layers \nWe find transferring weights and training the FC layers may not achieve good results in Section \n3.1. In order to further explore the potential of fine-tuning, we will adopt two other fine-tuning \napproaches, that is fine-tune CNN layers and fine-tune BN layers, in this section. The learning rate in \nfine-tune CNN layers is set to 0.0001, while the learning rate in fine-tune BN layers is set into 0.01. We \nfound that such a learning rate setting can make the network obtain better results. The experimental \nresults are shown in Table 4-6. \n \nTable 4.

The \nsmaller the data set, the better performance of fine-tuning can be improved. This indicates that \nfine-tuning CNN layers or BN layers are effective for ferrograph image classification, especially for the \nsmall data set. Moreover, the results of fine-tuning BN layers are better than those of fine-tuning CNN \nlayers or fine-tune both layers in most cases. Besides, the results of fine-tune both layers are better than \nthose of fine-tune CNN layers. This shows that the BN layers need to be fine-tuned for ferrograph \nimage classification tasks. A surprising result is that fine-tune BN layers achieve better results than \nthose of fine-tune both CNN and BN layers in most cases. Note that different learning rates are used in \nthese two fine-tuning methods. Therefore, this surprising result may be caused by different learning \nrates. In order to validate this conclusion, the following experiments are implemented. We set different \nlearning rate in different layers, that is, we set learning rate 0.01, 0.001and 0.0001 in BN layers, FC \nlayers and CNN layers respectively. The results are shown in Table 7. \n \nTable 7.

However, its’ improvements are small compared with fine-tuning \nBN layers. Therefore, fine-tune BN layers is an efficient approach. Since we need adopt a large \nlearning rate to update BN layer, it means the parameters of the BN layers in the pre-train models on \nImageNet are may vary greatly with those in the well convergent models on ferrograph image data set. \nHence, the parameters of the BN layers may relate to different kinds of datasets, that is, it may reflect \nthe semantic differences between different types of data sets. We will validate this conclusion in \nSection 3.4. \n3.3 Fine-tuning different BN layers \n \nThe experiment results in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 show that fine-tuning layers achieves good \nresults. Reference [10] shows that different CNN layers obtain different features. The shallow layers \nlearn general features while the deep layers learn semantic features. Therefore, it is a feasible and \neffective way to only fine-tine the deep layers of a model for small data sets. In order to explore \nwhether the fine-tuning BN layers has the same effect, we implement experiments of updating different \nBN layers. The results are shown in Table 8. \n \nAs shown in table 8, the more BN layers updated, the better results are obtained. Besides, \nupdating the first BN layer also achieves greater performance improvement.  \n \nTable 8.

The results show that fine-tune the \nCNN layers or the BN layers obtain better results than those learning from scratch.  In addition, \nfine-tuning BN layers are superior to fine-tuning CNN layers. Moreover, fine-tuning more BN layers \nobtain better results. In order to explore the possible reasons for these results, we further apply the \nformula (1) to analyze the weights difference of different well convergent models.  \n \nWe will analyze the difference between the parameters in CNN layers with fine-tuning and \npre-trained models provided by ImageNet. The details are as follows: we first fine-tune the CNN layers \nuntil the model is convergent. Then, the CNN weights of the convergent model will be compared to the \nweight of the original pre-trained model. In this study, the ResNet50 model and DenseNet121 model \nare used for experimental analysis. The experimental results are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.  \nAs shown in Figure 1-2, the CNN weights divergence of the shallow layers is small, while CNN \nweights divergence of the deep layers is large. This means that the shallow layers learn the general \nfeatures while the weights in deep layers are closely related to specific tasks. Thus, the weight \ndivergence of the shallow layers is small. Besides, the CNN weights divergence analysis on different \nferrograph image data sets shows that the weights difference increases with the increase of data \nquantity difference. In addition, the larger number of ferrograph image, the greater the difference \nbetween the fine-tuned weights and weights in pre-trained models. Combined with the experimental \nresults in Section 3.3, it is shown that when the number of the ferrograph image increase, the weights in \nthe model will make a large adjustment to the weights in the pre-trained model, and thus the fine-tuned \nmodel can learn the distribution of data better and achieve lower test error rate.  \nSimilarly, we analyze the parameters (both the weights and bias) divergence of BN layers. The \nweights divergence results are shown in Figure 3-4 and the bias divergence results are shown in Figure \n5-6. It can be seen from Figure 3-6 that the parameters of the BN layers after fine-tuned are greatly \ndifferent from that of the original parameters of the pre-trained BN layers. While the parameters of the \nBN layers after fine-tuned on different ferrograph image data set is a little different. This indicates the \nparameters of the BN layer are related to the semantic information of the data set. In addition, the \nparameter divergence of the BN layers is much greater than that of the CNN layers. This phenomenon \nsupports the argument in Section 3.3 that the BN layer should adopt a big learning rate, while the \nconvolution layer should adopt a small learning rate to fine-tune the model. Moreover, parameter \ndivergence in different BN layers seems to be the same, which verifies the experimental results in \nSection 3.3 that fine-tune all BN layers will get better results. What’s more, the bias difference of the \nlast BN layer is relatively large in most cases, which indicates that the bias of the last BN layer has \nstrong links with the specific task. \n \nResNet50-140\n140-280\nResNet50-280\n140-909\nLayer\nResNet50-909\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n0\n2\n4\n6\nCNN weight divergence\n10-4\n280-909\n \nFigure 1.

We can obtain the following \nconclusions in this study. \n(1) We can fine-tune the ImageNet pre-training model to achieve the classification of ferrograph \nimages. The less amount of ferrograph images, the greater improvement of fine-tuning.  \n(2) Parameters in the BN layers have strong links with the semantic information of different data \nset. Thus, the BN layers need to be updated if the target domain and the source domain have different \nsemantics. Besides, all BN layers should be updated. \n(3) Most experimental results show that fine-tuning BN layers is better than fine-tuning CNN \nlayers. In addition, setting different learning rates at different kinds of layers can further improve the \nperformance. \n(4) The results of weight difference analysis show that the weights of the shallow CNN layers are \nsmaller than those of the deep layers. However, the weight of the BN layers does not meet this rule, and \nthe weights of all the BN layers have great differences.  \nReference \n[1] \nKrizhevsky A, Sutskever I, Hinton G.
