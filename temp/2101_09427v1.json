  "abstract": "With an increase in Geospatial Linked Open Data being adopted and published\nover the web, there is a need to develop intuitive interfaces and systems for\nseamless and efficient exploratory analysis of such rich heterogeneous\nmulti-modal datasets. This work is geared towards improving the exploration\nprocess of Earth Observation (EO) Linked Data by developing a natural language\ninterface to facilitate querying. Questions asked over Earth Observation Linked\nData have an inherent spatio-temporal dimension and can be represented using\nGeoSPARQL. This paper seeks to study and analyze the use of RNN-based neural\nmachine translation with attention for transforming natural language questions\ninto GeoSPARQL queries. Specifically, it aims to assess the feasibility of a\nneural approach for identifying and mapping spatial predicates in natural\nlanguage to GeoSPARQL's topology vocabulary extension including - Egenhofer and\nRCC8 relations. The queries can then be executed over a triple store to yield\nanswers for the natural language questions.

Neural Machine Translation with Attention - Stacking of \nRNNs as an Encoder-Decoder Architecture to translate source \nNatural Language sequence to target GeoSPARQL sequence \nAlthough the encoder-decoder based RNN architecture has\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproved to be effective for machine translation, it has been\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nobserved that their performance deteriorates with longer\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninput sequences[8]. To address this issue, [9] and [10]\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npropose attention based NMT that enables the model to allot\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nimportance to specific words in the input sequence as each\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nword in the output sequence is being predicted. The\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nimportance allotted to words in the input sequence is\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquantified by assigning weights to them - termed as\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nattention weights​. These ​attention weights are then used by\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe decoder to predict words in the output sequence.  \nFigure 2 depicts the NMT with attention architecture for\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntranslating natural language questions to GeoSPARQL\n \n \n \n \n \n \nqueries.\nThe\nbidirectional\nrecurrent\nneural\nnetwork\n \n \n \n \n \n \nencoder-decoder\narchitecture\nwith\nBahdanau Attention\n \n \n \n \n \nmechanism has been implemented for this study.

CONCLUSION \n \nIn the background of increasing adoption of Geospatial\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLinked Open Data, this work advocates the development of\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nintuitive and seamless systems for effective exploration of\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsuch heterogeneous and multimodal datasets. In that regard,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthis work proposes to develop a natural language interface\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nfor\nquerying\nover\ngeospatial\nlinked\ndata.\nAlthough\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGeospatial\nLinked\nData\ncan\nbe\nqueried upon using\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGeoSPARQL, a background of the query language in\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naddition to knowledge and understanding of databases is\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nessential for this purpose. Thus a natural language interface\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nwould\nshield\na\nprospective\nuser\nfrom\nthe technical\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nknow-how and also enable her/him to effectively utilize the\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunderlying knowledge residing in the database. The paper\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndiscusses the neural machine translation with attention\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napproach for translating natural language questions to\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGeoSPARQL queries, specifically focussing on mapping\n \n \n \n \n \n \nspatial predicates of natural language to Egenhofer and\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRCC8 predicates of GeoSPARQL. From the experiments\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith our dataset, NMT with attention seems a promising\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \napproach\nfor\nnatural\nlanguage\ninterfacing\nwith\n \n \n \n \n \n \nGeoSPARQL. The dataset created as a part of this work is\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \nenvisaged to be enriched further to improve the diversity of\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnatural language questions and contribute to the area of\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnatural language question answering over EO Linked Data. \n \n5.
