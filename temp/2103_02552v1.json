INTRODUCTION\nAcoustic echo cancellation (AEC) is the task of removing undesired\nechoes that result from the coupling between a loudspeaker and a mi-\ncrophone in a communication system [1]. Modern hands-free com-\nmunication devices are usually equipped with multiple microphones\nand loudspeakers. The availability of additional devices also elevates\nthe need for enhanced sound quality and realism, which can hardly\nbe satisﬁed with single-channel AEC. Therefore, it is necessary to\ndesign AEC for multiple loudspeakers and/or microphones, which\nleads to the study of MCAEC and MMAEC. MCAEC and MMAEC\npresent additional challenges and opportunities compared to single-\nchannel AEC and have received considerable attention recently.\nMulti-channel AEC refers to the setup with at least two loud-\nspeakers or channels (stereophonic sound). Although conceptually\nsimilar, MCAEC is fundamentally different from single-channel\nAEC and a straightforward generalization of single-channel AEC\ndoes not result in satisfactory performance because of the non-\nuniqueness problem [2].\nThis problem is due to the correlation\nbetween loudspeaker signals. As a result, the convergence of adap-\ntive technique could be degraded and the echo paths cannot be\ndetermined uniquely [2].\nMany methods have been proposed to\ncircumvent this problem [3, 4, 5, 6], among which coherence re-\nduction methods are most commonly used. Such methods, however,\ninevitably degrade sound quality, and a compromise must be made\nbetween enhanced convergence and sound quality corruption [2, 7].\nMMAEC is required for situations in which multiple micro-\nphones are present and beamforming techniques are usually com-\nbined with AEC for efﬁcient reduction of noise and acoustic echoes.\nThe most straightforward ways of combining these two processing\nmodules are applying AEC separately for each microphone signal\nbefore beamforming or applying a single-microphone AEC to the\noutput of a beamformer [8]. In general, the former scheme out-\nperforms the latter one [9]. Other algorithms employ relative echo\ntransfer functions [10, 11] or joint optimization strategies [12, 13]\nto improve the MMAEC performance. However, efﬁcient combina-\ntions of AEC and beamforming are still challenging and many of the\nstrategies exhibit convergence deﬁciencies [7].\nRecently, deep learning based methods have been proposed for\nsolving AEC problems and have shown to be effective for echo and\nnoise removal, especially in situations with nonlinear distortions\n[14, 15, 16, 17]. On the basis of the deep learning based single-\nchannel AEC approach, we investigate AEC setups with multiple\nloudspeakers and microphones. The BLSTM based and CRN [18]\nbased methods are introduced to address MCAEC and MMAEC\nproblems. Evaluation results show that the proposed methods effec-\ntively remove acoustic echo and background noise in the presence\nof nonlinear distortions.\nThe proposed work has four major advantages over traditional\nmethods. First, although there are multiple acoustic paths in the\nMCAEC and MMAEC setups, the deep learning based approach\ncan naturally address the problem with model training, rather than\nemploying a separate AEC module for each echo path. Second, in-\nstead of estimating echo paths, deep learning based MCAEC works\nby directly estimating near-end speech, which intrinsically avoids\nthe non-uniqueness problem. Third, combining deep learning based\nAEC and deep learning based beamforming elevates AEC perfor-\nmance remarkably. Fourth, deep learning based methods can re-\nmove echo and noise simultaneously in the presence of nonlinear\ndistortions.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nSec-\ntion 2 presents the deep learning based approach for MCAEC and\nMMAEC. Experiments and evaluation results are given in Section\n3. Section 4 concludes the paper.\n2. METHOD DESCRIPTION\n2.1. Deep learning based AEC\nAs is shown in Fig. 1(a), the microphone signal y(n) in the single-\nchannel AEC setup is a mixture of echo d(n), near-end speech s(n),\nand background noise v(n):\ny(n) = d(n) + s(n) + v(n)\n(1)\narXiv:2103.02552v1  [eess.AS]  3 Mar 2021\nNear-End Room\nℎ!(𝑛)\n𝑥(𝑛)\n𝑠\"(𝑛)\n𝑑\"(𝑛)\n𝑑!

Deep learning for AEC: (a) BLSTM based method, (b) CRN\nbased method. Subscripts r, i, and m denote real, imaginary and\nmagnitude spectra of signals, respectively.\nwhere echo is generated by convolving a loudspeaker signal with\na room impulse response (RIR) (h(n)). We formulate AEC as a\nsupervised speech separation problem and the overall approach is to\nestimate the near-end speech from microphone signal with far-end\nsignal used as additional information. The diagrams of deep learning\nbased methods are shown in Fig. 2. The input signals, sampled at 16\nkHz, are windowed into 20 ms frames with a 10-ms overlap between\nconsecutive frames. Then a 320-point short time Fourier transform\n(STFT) is applied to each frame to extract the real, imaginary, and\nmagnitude spectra of signals, which are denoted as ∗r, ∗i, and ∗m,\nrespectively.\n2.1.1. BLSTM based AEC\nA BLSTM is trained to predict the spectral magnitude mask (SMM)\nof near-end speech from the magnitude spectrograms of input signals\n(Ym and Xm), as is shown in Fig. 2(a). The SMM is deﬁned as:\nSMM(t, f) = min{1, |Sm(t, f)|/|Ym(t, f)|}\n(2)\nwhere |Sm(t, f)| and |Ym(t, f)| denote the spectral magnitudes of\nnear-end speech and microphone signal within a T-F unit at frame t\nand frequency f, respectively. Once the model is trained, the esti-\nmated spectral magnitude of near-end speech ˆSm is obtained from\npoint-wise multiplication of Ym and estimated SMM. Then ˆSm,\nalong with the phase of microphone signal, is sent to the inverse\nshort time Fourier transform to derive an estimated near-end signal\nˆs(n). A detailed description of the BLSTM based method is given\nin [14].\n2.1.2. CRN based AEC\nThe CRN based method trains the CRN, which is a causal system,\nfor complex spectral mapping [18]. As is shown in Fig. 2(b), it es-\ntimates the real and imaginary spectrograms of near-end speech ( ˆSr\nand ˆSi) from the real and imaginary spectrograms of microphone\nsignal and far-end signal (Yr, Yi, Xr, and Xi). Hence, it is capable\nof enhancing both magnitude and phase responses simultaneously\nand ˆs(n) resynthesized achieves better speech quality. A detailed\ndescription the CRN architecture is provided in [15].\n2.2. Deep learning for MCAEC\nWithout loss of generality, let us take stereophonic AEC as an ex-\nample to study deep learning based MCAEC. The signal model is\ngiven in Fig. 1(b) where the stereophonic signals, x1(n) and x2(n)\nare transmitted to loudspeakers and then coupled to one of the mi-\ncrophones. The signal picked up by microphone j is composed of\ntwo echo signals d1j(n), d2j(n), near-end speech sj(n), and back-\nground noise vj(n):\nyj(n) = P2\ni=1 dij(n) + sj(n) + vj(n),\nj = 1, 2.\n(3)\nwhere dij(n) = xi(n) ∗hij(n), i = 1, 2, hij(n) denotes the echo\npath from loudspeaker i to microphone j, and ∗denotes linear con-\nvolution.\nDeep learning based MCAEC works by estimating the target\nsj(n) given yj(n), x1(n), and x2(n) as inputs. Speciﬁcally, for\nBLSMT based MCAEC, we use [Yjm, X1m, X2m] as inputs and\ntrain the BLSTM to estimate the SMM of sj(n). For CRN based\nAEC, we use [Yjr, Yji, X1r, X1i, X2r, X2i] as inputs and train the\nnetwork to estimate [Sjr, Sji]. The training signals are generated by\nrandomly selecting j from {1, 2}, i.e. the model is exposed to sig-\nnals picked up by the two microphones in MCAEC during training.\nA model trained this way is able to achieve echo removal for both\nmicrophones in the system.\n2.3. Deep learning for MMAEC\nConsidering an MMAEC setup with one loudspeaker and M micro-\nphones, as is shown in Fig. 1(b). The signal picked up by micro-\nphone j is\nyj(n) = dj(n) + sj(n) + vj(n),\nj = 1, 2, · · · M\n(4)\nwhere dj(n) = x(n) ∗hj(n) is the echo received at microphone j.\nDifferent from traditional MMAEC methods that may need to\nemploy a separate AEC module for each microphone in the array,\ndeep learning based MMAEC can be trained to achieve echo removal\nfor all the microphones in the array with a single DNN. During train-\ning, we use yj(n) and x(n) as inputs and set the training target to\nthe corresponding near-end speech sj(n). The training signals are\ngenerated by randomly choosing j from {1, 2, · · · , M}.\nOnce the model is trained, the outputs of deep learning based\nMMAEC could be used for deep learning based minimum variance\ndistortion-less response (MVDR) beamforming [19]. Choosing the\nﬁrst microphone in the array as reference microphone, the MVDR\nbeamformer can be constructed as:\nˆ\nw(f) =\nˆΦ−1\nN (f)ˆc(f)\nˆc(f)H ˆΦ−1\nN (f)ˆc(f)\n(5)\nwhere (·)H denotes conjugate transpose, ˆΦN(f) is the estimated\ncovariance matrix of overall interference (acoustic echo and back-\nground noise), ˆc(f) is the estimated steering vector, which is esti-\nmated as the principal eigenvector of the estimated speech covari-\nance matrix ˆΦs(f) [19, 20]. The covariance matrices of speech and\noverall interference are estimated from the output of deep learning\nbased MMAEC as\nˆΦS(f) = 1\nT\nP\nt ˆS(t, f) ˆS\nH(t, f)\n(6)\nˆΦN(f) = 1\nT\nP\nt ˆ\nN(t, f) ˆ\nN\nH(t, f)\n(7)\nwhere ˆS(t, f) is the STFT representation of estimated speech sig-\nnals and ˆ\nN(t, f) is the estimated overall interference obtained as\nY (t, f) −ˆS(t, f), T is the total number of frames used in the sum-\nmation.\nThe beamformer is usually applied on microphone signal\nY (t, f) and the enhancement results are calculated from\nYbf(t, f) = ˆ\nwH(f)Y (t, f)\n(8)\nConsidering that MVDR beamformer performs spatial ﬁltering to\nmaintain signals from the desired direction while suppressing inter-\nferences from other directions. A trick we used is to employ the\nMVDR beamformer as a post-ﬁlter for further enhancement. It can\nbe implemented by feeding the output of DNN based MMAEC for-\nward to the deep learning based beamformer with the latter calcu-\nlated using the same DNN. The overall structure is shown in Fig. 3.\nThe further enhanced output is obtained using\nˆSbf(t, f) = ˆ\nwH(f) ˆS(t, f)\n(9)\n3. EXPERIMENTS\n3.1. Experiment setting\nThe simulation setups for evaluation are designed as follows.\nThe near-end and far-end speech signals are generated using the\nTIMIT dataset [21] by following the same way provided in [15].\n𝑦\"\n…\n𝑦#\n𝑦$\n…\n…\nOne DNN\n𝑠̂#\nDNN-AEC\nDNN-AEC\nDNN-AEC\nAcoustic \nBeamforming\n𝒘\n𝑠̂\"\n𝑠̂$\n𝒔)\n𝒚\n𝑠̂+,\nFig. 3. Diagram of combining deep learning based AEC with deep\nlearning based beamforming for further enhancement.\nEcho signals are generated by convolving far-end signals with\nRIRs generated using the image method [22].\nTo investigate\nRIRs generalization, we simulate 20 different rooms of size a ×\nb × c m (width×length×height) for training mixtures, where\na = [4, 6, 8, 10], b = [5, 7, 9, 11, 13], c = 3. For MCAEC setup,\nthe two microphones and the two loudspeakers are positioned at\n(a, b + 0.05, c) m, (a, b −0.05, c) m, (a, b + 0.6, c + 0.5) m, and\n(a, b −0.6, c + 0.5) m, respectively. The near-end speaker is put\nat 20 random positions in each room with 1 meter apart from the\ncenter of the microphones.\nThe setup of MMAEC consists of a\nuniform linear array with four microphones and one loudspeaker.\nThe center of the microphone array is positioned at the center of the\nroom with 4 cm inter-microphone distance. Twenty pairs of posi-\ntions are simulated randomly for the loudspeaker and the near-end\nspeaker in each room, and the distance from the loudspeaker and\nthe near-end speaker to the center of the array are set to 0.6 m and 1\nm, respectively. The reverberation time (T60) is randomly selected\nfrom {0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6} s, and the length of RIR is set to 512.\nFor testing, we simulate three rooms of size 3 × 4 × 3 m (Room 1),\n5 × 6 × 3 m (Room 2), 11 × 14 × 3 m (Room3), and set T60 to 0.35\ns to generate test RIRs for both MCAEC and MMAEC setups.\nThe most common nonlinear distortion generated by a loud-\nspeaker is the saturation type nonlinearity, which is usually simu-\nlated using the scaled error function (SEF) [23, 24]:\nfSEF(x) =\nZ x\n0\ne\n−z2\n2η2 dz,\n(10)\nwhere x is the input to the loudspeaker, η2 represents the strength\nof nonlinearity. The SEF becomes linear as η2 tends to inﬁnity and\nbecomes a hard limiter as η2 tends to zero. To investigate the ro-\nbustness of the proposed method against nonlinear distortions, four\nloudspeaker functions are used during the training stage: η2 = 0.1\n(severe nonlinearity), η2 = 1 (moderate nonlinearity), η2 = 10 (soft\nnonlinearity), and η2 = ∞(linear).\nBabble noise from NOISEX-92 dataset [25] is used as the back-\nground noise and the algorithm proposed in [26] is employed to\nmake the noise diffuse. The diffuse babble noise is then split into\ntwo parts, the ﬁrst 80% of it is used for training and the remaining is\nused for testing.\nWe create 20000 training mixtures and 100 test mixtures for\nboth MCAEC and MMAEC setups. Each training mixture is cre-\nated by ﬁrst convolving a loudspeaker signal (generated using ran-\ndomly selected far-end signal and loudspeaker function) with a ran-\ndomly chosen training RIR for loudspeaker to generate an echo. A\nrandomly chosen near-end utterance is convolved with an RIR for\nnear-end speaker and then mixed with the echo at a signal-to-echo\nratio (SER) randomly chosen from {−6, −3, 0, 3, 6} dB. Finally, the\ndiffuse babble noise is added to the mixture at a signal-to-noise ra-\ntio (SNR) randomly chosen from {8, 10, 12, 14} dB. The SER and\nSNR, which are evaluated during double-talk periods, are deﬁned as:\nSER = 10 log10\n\u0002P\nn s2(n)/ P\nn d2(n)\n\u0003\n(11)\nTable 1.\nPerformance of MCAEC methods in the presence of\ndouble-talk, background noise with 3.5 dB SER, 10 dB SNR, η2 =\n∞(linear system).\nMicrophone 1\nERLE\nPESQ\nRIRs\nRoom1\nRoom2\nRoom3\nRoom1\nRoom2\nRoom3\nUnprocessed\n-\n-\n-\n2.12\n2.13\n2.17\nSJONLMS\n7.54\n7.63\n7.62\n2.41\n2.45\n2.47\nSJONLMS-PF\n19.04\n18.88\n18.67\n2.45\n2.48\n2.53\nBLSTM\n43.19\n67.17\n67.54\n2.57\n2.67\n2.76\nCRN\n32.68\n35.34\n41.31\n2.62\n2.83\n2.98\nMicrophone 2\nERLE\nPESQ\nRIRs\nRoom1\nRoom2\nRoom3\nRoom1\nRoom2\nRoom3\nUnprocessed\n-\n-\n-\n2.11\n2.14\n2.18\nSJONLMS\n7.51\n7.76\n7.63\n2.41\n2.45\n2.45\nSJONLMS-PF\n18.98\n18.89\n18.60\n2.45\n2.50\n2.50\nBLSTM\n49.12\n67.47\n67.67\n2.55\n2.68\n2.76\nCRN\n31.25\n36.61\n41.57\n2.60\n2.85\n2.99\nSNR = 10 log10\n\u0002P\nn s2(n)/ P\nn v2(n)\n\u0003\n(12)\nTest mixtures are created similarly but using different utterances,\nnoises, RIRs, SERs and SNRs.\nThe AMSGrad optimizer [27] and the mean squared error\n(MSE) cost function are used to train both BLSTM based and CRN\nbased methods.\nThe networks are trained for 30 epochs with a\nlearning rate of 0.001. The performance of MCAEC and MMAEC\nis evaluated in terms of utterance-level echo return loss enhance-\nment (ERLE) [1] for single-talk periods and perceptual evaluation\nof speech quality (PESQ) [28] for double-talk periods.\n3.2. Performance of MCAEC methods\nWe ﬁrst evaluate the performance of deep learning based MCAEC.\nThe proposed methods are compared with the stereophonic version\nof joint-optimized normalized least mean square algorithm [29]\nequipped with a coherence reduction technique proposed in [30]\n(SJONLMS). And post-ﬁltering (PF) [31] is employed to further\nsuppress noises and residual echo (SJONLMS-PF). The parame-\nters for these methods are set accordingly to the values given in\n[29, 30, 31]. The comparison results are given in Table 1. In gen-\neral, the proposed BLSTM based and CRN based MCAEC methods\noutperform conventional methods and the performance generalizes\nwell to untrained RIRs.\nBLSTM based method achieves better\nERLE results while the CRN based method outperforms all other\nmethods in terms of PESQ.\n3.3. Performance of MMAEC methods\nThis part studies the performance of deep learning based MMAEC.\nWe employ single-channel JONLMS [29] for each microphone in\nthe array as a baseline and then combine the outputs with the ideal\nMVDR beamformer (JONLMS-IBF). The ideal MVDR beamformer\n(IBF) is calculated by substituting the true speech and interference\ncomponents of the microphone signal (S(t, f) and N(t, f)) into\n(6), (7), and (5). Therefore, it can be regarded as a stronger base-\nline compared to other MVDR beamformers. Three results are pro-\nvided for each deep learning based method, in which ˆs is the output\nof the reference microphone, ybf and ˆsbf are, respectively, the time-\ndomain beamformed microphone signal and beamformed enhanced\nsignal introduced in Section 2.3. The comparison results are given\nin Table 2. As can be seen from the table, deep learning based meth-\nods outperform traditional MMAEC methods in terms of ERLE and\nPESQ.

Performance in situations with nonlinear distortions\nThis part tests the performance of BLSTM based and CRN based\nMCAEC and MMAEC in situations with nonlinear distortions intro-\nduced by loudspeaker. The results are shown in Table 3. Comparing\nthe results with those without nonlinear distortions shows that the\ndeep learning based methods can be trained to handle cases with and\nwithout nonlinear distortions and the performance generalizes well\nto untrained nonlinearity (η2 = 0.5).\n4. CONCLUSION\nWe have proposed a deep learning approach to MCAEC and\nMMAEC. Our approach overcomes the limitations of traditional\nmethods and produces remarkable performance in terms of ERLE\nand PESQ. Evaluation results show the effectiveness of both BLSTM\nand CRN based methods for removing echo and noise in cases with\nand without nonlinear distortions, and the performance generalizes\nwell to untrained RIRs. Moreover, the proposed methods can be\nextended to handle a general AEC setup with an arbitrary number of\nmicrophones and an arbitrary number of loudspeakers, which will\nbe demonstrated in future research.\n5.
