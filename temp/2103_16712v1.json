Such project can be an\nexcellent source of data for the various research\nteams working on these languages.\nIt would\nindeed be for them and for us as well, an excellent\nstarting point for the realization of various types\nof research project:\ndevelopment of the NLP\ntools (tokenizer, lemmatizer, stemmizer, tagger,\nmorpho-syntactic analyzer, semantic analyzer,\netc.), Natural Language Understanding (NLU)\n(chatbot, language intention detection), and AI\n(automatic translator, spell checker, sentiment\nanalyzer, document classiﬁcation, etc.).\nIn this article, we want to share a brief statisti-\ncal review of our current lexicographic resources\nfrom our collaborative platforms. We will give\n1These languages, like most of the subsaharan languages,\nwhich are hardly the focus of studies in ﬁelds like NLP.\nsome current limitations of our XND format and\nthe redesign project to consider this year.\n2\nOverview of NTeALan project\nOriginally initiated as a project in 2017, New\nTechnologies for Africans Languages (NTeALan)\nassociation initial orientation was to transpose all\nthe latest advances of NLP, NLU and AI to african\nlanguages, in terms of operational linguistic\ntools and resources (useful for African national\nlanguages), at the service of research, businesses\nand populations.\nThus, NTeALan’s (Mboning\net al., 2019) aim is to create collaborative and\nopen-source platforms to enable Africans, united\nin linguistic communities,\nto be themselves\nactors in the digitization of their languages and\ncultures. To achieve this, we decided to rely on\nthe full-ﬂedged collaboration-based model (from\nExperience Models) proposed by (Holtzblatt and\nBeyer, 2017), because we believe speakers of\none language, brought together in a community\nof contributors, would combine their social,\ncultural and professional knowledge to promote\nthe technological development and popularization\nof their languages.\nOur work, supported by our partners’s contri-\nbution, has enabled us, in 3 years of existence, to\nconduct several projects2. They are some of the\nmain tools we developed:\n• The lexicographic data management platform:\nmade up of an open-source REST API 3 and\na management web application, it allows us\nto create, store and distribute/share the plat-\nform’s linguistic resources. To date, we have\nmore than 10 sub-Saharan languages variously\nequipped and processed by our systems, in-\ncluding several NLP tools.\n2NTeALan’s publications: https://ntealan.org/publication\n3https://apis.ntealan.net/ntealan/dictionaries\narXiv:2103.16712v1  [cs.CL]  30 Mar 2021\n• The collaborative dictionary platform 4: used\nby linguistic communities and members of the\nassociation to consult, comment and discuss\non the articles of our existing dictionaries5.\nThis platform exploits the resources produced\nthanks to another lexicographic data creation\nplatform 6, both are REST API dependent.\n• Several REST and websocket APIs to make\npublic and distribute NLP and NLU process-\ning services in African languages.\nMost of this work is still functional prototypes\nthat we want to enrich in order to make people\noutside NTeALan beneﬁt from them.\n3\nContext of the work\nEach lexical resource management platform has\nits own model for structuring and presenting data,\nthis is the case for the following platforms: Kosh\n(Mondaca et al., 2019), ELEXIS Dictionary\nService, Djibiki (Mangeot, 2006).\nThe\nXML format (mainly the TEI and LMF standards)\nis today a choice of reference for the structuring\nof linguistic, lexicographic and terminographic\ndata. We can also cite the TEI Lex-0 (Romary\nand Tasovac, 2018) and Lexicog (OntoLex Lemon\nLexicography from W3C) formats, which are\nfrequently used to codify lexicographic resources.\nUnfortunately, these standards are often not\nadapted to represent and describe certain morpho-\nsyntactic peculiarities of African languages 7.\nIndeed, several linguistic phenomena, such as\nthe concept of nominal class, the notion of clicks\nand the management of the translation and the\nlocalization of the dialect variants of the entry of\nan article, are not dealt with explicitly, despite all\nthe needs expressed in the subject 8.\nOur approach of creating lexical resources is\nbased on the collaboration model.\nIndeed our\ncurrent platforms are essentially collaborative.\n4https://ntealan.net/dictionaries\n5Article, in the context of lexicography, is considered as\nthe content of language dictionary entry (lemmatized form of\nword).\n6https://ntealan.net/dictionaries-platform\n7Certainly for the same reasons, none of these authors have\ntried these formats for African languages.\n8Note that it is nevertheless possible in these standards to\nadd new formalisms (tags and attributes) in addition to the\nexisting classes. Although this extensibility is possible, their\nimplementation will ﬁnd reservations in the speciﬁcation of\nthe linguistic properties and the worldviews concerned.\nThey allow native speakers, experts and teachers\nof each language to be themselves actors and\nproducers of content for their languages and\nculture, this was our purpose at the creation of\nNTeALan’s dictionary platforms. However, given\nthe shortcomings observed, we are aware that these\nplatforms should be improved. Thus, within the\nframework of this project, our approach will take\ninto account several upstream technological factors\naffecting all our existing platforms, both in terms\nof functionality, performance and respect of the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules.\nTo contextualize our work, a ﬁrst collaborative\nplatform (Mboning et al., 2020) was set up in 2018.\nPrimary data were extracted from old bilingual\nlexicographical work available in open access on\nthe internet (Mboning, 2016, 2018). In order to\nfacilitate the processing and distribution of our\nlexicographic data, and based on the state of the\nart ((Prinsloo et al., 2012; Prinsloo, 2012; Heid,\n2014; Mangeot and Enguehard, 2011; El Azrak\nand El Hamdaoui, 2011), etc.) on lexicography\nin Africa, we created a proprietary structuring\nmodel that we called XML Ntealan Dictionaries\n(XND) (Mboning Tchiaze et al., 2020), based on\nthe Extensible Markup Language (XML) format.\nXND format (cf. ﬁgure 1) allowed us to en-\ncapsulate and codify many bilingual dictionaries\nin African languages from different data sources\n(PDF, Word, XML, Excel ﬁles; SIL Toolbox for-\nmat; HTML pages). These digital dictionaries are\ncurrently distributed free of charge on our online\nREST API 9 and are available on the collaborative\ndictionaries platform 10.\nFigure 1: Formal structure of NTeALan’s XND format)\n9https://apis.ntealan.net/ntealan/dictionaries\n10https://ntealan.net/dictionaries-platform\n4\nFirst statistics on current lexicographic\ndata\nAfter more than 2 years of existence, the data on\nthe platform has grown from 12,000 article entries\nto over 32,000 articles (equivalent to over 108054\nunique words). To be more precise, 18 dictionaries\nwere created with articles between 0 and 12000 .\nThe table 1 and the ﬁgure 3 below give a global\nand detailed overview of the current statistics 11.\ndico\narticles\ncomment.\nconsult.\ncontrib.\n18\n32090\n99\n13958\n156\nTable 1:\nGeneral statistics of dictionaries on the\nNTeALan platform (Record of 05/02/2021)\nFigure 2: Global view extract from platform (Record\nof 05/02/2021)\nThese resources were produced by contributors\nfrom several countries. To date, there are more\nthan 135 users / contributors on the platform, with\na total of 18 African languages processed and\nmore than 6 foreign languages. At the initiative\nof the NLP course for Master degree students\nof the African languages and linguistics (LAL)\ndepartment of the University of Douala, more\nthan 10 dictionaries have been initialized and are\nconstantly maintained. This student mobilization\nallowed many of their classmates to join us.\nFigures 4 and 5 summarize the linguistic diversity\nof users of the platform.\nOn the other hand, Western languages (spoken\nas a second or ﬁrst language in Africa) are fairly\nwell represented (cf. ﬁgure 6). No doubt with\ngood reason, the French language occupies the ﬁrst\nplace, forwarded by English and German. This can\nbe explained by the fact that these languages are\nmainly spoken in Central Africa (stronghold of the\nproject).\n11For the table 1: contrib. = user contributions, Dico =\ndictionaries, consult. = number of articles viewed, comment.\n= number of comments on the articles.\nOur platforms indicate that our main contribu-\ntors are mainly from Cameroon and France. The\nproﬁles of these contributors also varied. To date\nabout 43% of women and 57% of men are repre-\nsented in 14 countries in Africa and Europe.\n5\nLimitations of the XND format\nThe simplicity of the XND format as desired from\nthe start served as exemplary the ﬁrst waves of\ndictionary Xmlization, created by the communi-\nties of local speakers and students. However, in\nits current state, this format does not allow us to\nproject on the collaborative model of synchronous\nor asynchronous resource creation. There are sev-\neral reasons for this ﬁnding:\n• The linguistic properties of the 4 major\nfamilies of African languages are under-\nrepresented in the current format. Yet these\nallow them to share, according to their family\nto which they belong, the same socio-cultural\ncode.\nBetween families, subfamilies, lan-\nguage groups and subgroups, connections of\nall kinds can be clearly identiﬁed. They are\nfull of both linguistic and cultural information\nthat could enrich our different lexicographic\ncontent and therefore the current format.\n• The management of communities of contrib-\nutors has not been codiﬁed in this format, al-\nthough it is taken into account in the dictio-\nnary platform. Metadata relating to collabora-\ntion information should at best be an integral\npart of XML data for better traceability useful\nto the end user and NLP tools.\n• The management of external applications and\nstandardization were at the heart of the chal-\nlenges of deﬁning the XND format. But, faced\nwith the increasing scale of our platforms and\nits internationalization, the internal structure\n(tag names and attributes) must be reviewed\nto better align with existing standards, while\nkeeping its speciﬁcity.\n• The search engine applied to this format is\nnot so effective in ﬁnding information desired\nby the user. Is it an algorithm problem ? It\nmust be said that to date, the implementation\nof complex cross-search processes has still\nnot been done: the manipulation of XML data\nin a database remains problematic.\nFigure 3: Current frequency of articles in each dictionary in the platform: this distribution shows an average of\napproximately 1000 articles and 500 users consultations per dictionary. (Record of 05/02/2021)\nFigure 4: Number of speakers and contributors to the platform grouped by mother tongue (Record of 05/02/2021)\nThe XND format must evolve to better serve\nAfrican languages in their entirety.\nIt must\nalso continue to respect the 3 basic princi-\nples representation, simplification\nand extensibility which underpinned its\ncreation. Should we stay on an XML formalism\n? improve or enrich it ? or test other modes of\nknowledge representation ?\n6\nThe future of the XND format\nThe future of XND format will be more semantic\nand communities based structure following the\nstate of the art. The modeling proposed by (Bosch\net al., 2007) turns out to be particularly interesting\nfor us in different aspects:\n• First, the context: the authors were called\nupon to do pioneering work since they were\nthe ﬁrst to develop a model for describing lex-\nical entries speciﬁc to the Bantu languages of\nSouth Africa. We are working in a similar con-\ntext since there is not yet, to our knowledge,\na speciﬁc and standard description format for\nsome of the languages described in our dic-\nFigure 5: Platform contributors grouped by their ofﬁcial language (Record of 05/02/2021)\nFigure 6: Origins of our contributors to the platform. ’None’ represent people who wished to remain anonymous\n(Record of 05/02/2021)\ntionaries. Of course, we are not talking about\na general model (which already exists) appli-\ncable to different languages, but a speciﬁc\ndata format that takes into account the par-\nticularities of the Mandingue and semi-Bantu\nlanguages concerned. etc.\n• linguistic information: the description method\nproposed by (Bosch et al., 2007) can take into\nconsideration various types of linguistic in-\nformation (nominal classes for example) spe-\nciﬁc to Bantu languages, which are also found\nin certain languages on which we work: du-\nala, bassa, yemba, medumba, ghomala, etc.\nThis particularity represents a great advan-\ntage since most of the existing models only\ncover part of the aspects speciﬁc to African\nlanguages, more precisely those treated in our\ndictionaries (duala, bassa, yemba, fe’efe’e,\nmedumba, etc.).\n• the approach:\nthe proposed method is\nlargely in line with the approach we want to\nimplement as part of our project to overhaul\nthe NTeALan dictionary format, in particular\na semantic modeling in which the dictionary\narticles will be structured around the mean-\nings of the terms (the meaning constitutes the\nentry). Indeed, we wish to develop an internal\nstructuring of the articles of our dictionaries\naround the meaning, via graphs connected to\neach other. To do this, like (Faaß et al., 2014),\nwe opted for the highlighting of the meaning\nat the entry of the articles of the dictionaries.\nAs for the generation of graphs, it will be pos-\nsible thanks to the use of OWL 2 technologies.\n7\nConclusion\nIn this article, we presented the work of the re-\nsearch team of the NTeALan association. More\nprecisely, a statistical assessment of the resources\nbuilt in collaboration with our communities of con-\ntributors. It emerges that the codiﬁcation format\n(XND) of our lexicographic resources must evolve\nto better cover our collaborative community-based\nmodel in order to better satisfy our users which\nis useful for the implementation of NLP tools for\nAfrican languages. This will be our next challenge.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was made possible thanks to all the vol-\nuntary contributors of the NTeALan association\nand its research team.\nReferences\nSonja E Bosch, Laurette Pretorius, and Jackie Jones.\n2007.
