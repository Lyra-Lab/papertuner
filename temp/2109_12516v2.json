INTRODUCTION\nR\nEINFORCEMENT learning (RL) has substantially con-\ntributed to numerous ﬁelds [1]–[4] by solving control\nand optimization problems. As a branch of machine learning\nmethods, RL improves the capability of controlling agents in\nblack-box environments through the exploratory trial-and-error\nprinciple [5]. Recent popular RL algorithms, e.g., rainbow\ndeep Q-learning [6], proximal policy optimization (PPO) [7],\nand soft actor-critic (SAC) [8], have shown ability in handling\nhigh-dimensional environment representation and generaliza-\ntion, due to the introduction of deep neural networks. Albeit\nRL can achieve good performance in complex tasks, its draw-\nback emerges that their interactions with the environment are\nvery inefﬁcient [9]. Thus, using RL to solve a problem needs\nskillful deﬁnitions and settings and consumes remarkable\ncomputational resources [10].\nCombining human guidance with RL can be a promising\nway to mitigate the above drawback [11].

DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3177685\nThe code associated with this paper is available at this link\nvention has been used to improve RL performance. Interven-\ntion is triggered by unfavorable actions and should be avoided\nby RL. Then, the human demonstration is a powerful tool\nto enhance RL’s ability [12]. In this context, the objective\nfunctions are generally reshaped compatible with supervised\nlearning to improve efﬁciency [13]. Despite the above hu-\nman guidance-based methods, RL needs to process numerous\ndata from its self-explorations. The existing methods do not\nparticularly optimize the utilization of human guidance data;\nconsequently, they still need great human workloads to avoid\nsubmersion of guidance in exploratory data. Additionally,\nhuman guidance, which is variant to proﬁciency, mental and\nphysical status of participants, should not be equally treated\nsince some low-quality guidance can even impair the RL\nperformance.\nWe propose a priority-based experience replay method\non human guidance and put forward the associated human\nguidance-based RL algorithm to bridge the abovementioned\ngap. Our approach is off-policy, which leverages the experi-\nence replay mechanism [14] to maximize the utilization efﬁ-\nciency of self-exploratory data. The proposed priority replay\nmechanism can further improve the utilization efﬁciency of\nhuman guidance data by quantifying their values and weighing\ntheir utilized probability, which ultimately augments the RL\nperformance. As a result, the efﬁciency can be improved\nby over seven times under the adopted task. The schematic\ndiagram of our algorithm is depicted in Fig. 1. To evaluate\nthe training and testing performance of our proposed method,\nwe design two challenging autonomous driving scenarios.\nThe experimental results suggest the advance of the proposed\nalgorithm compared to state-of-the-art baselines in learning\nefﬁciency, practical performance, and robustness.\nThe contribution of this report can be summarized into\nthree aspects. 1) We propose a novel prioritized experience\nutilization mechanism regarding human guidance in the RL\nprocess to improve performance. 2) We establish a com-\nprehensive and holistic framework of human guidance-based\nRL by integrating the human-RL action switch scheme, be-\nhavior cloning-based objective function, human-demonstration\nreplay method, and human-intervention reward shaping mech-\nanism.3) We validate the superior performance of the proposed\nalgorithm in solving challenging autonomous driving tasks\ncomprehensively.\nThe remainder is organized as follows: a review of related\nwork is provided in Section II, preliminaries for the proposed\narXiv:2109.12516v2  [cs.LG]  29 Nov 2022\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021\n2\nHuman-RL authority transfer\nRL algorithm\n(shaped for human guidance)\nEnvironment \n(controlled object)\nTDQA \npriority calculation\nHuman guidance\nRL exploratory \nexperience\nHuman-guidance \nexperience\nReplay for \nlearning\nState transition\nAction\n𝑎𝑎𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅\nAction\n𝑎𝑎𝐻𝐻\nObservation\nObservation\nInteraction \ninformation (tuple)\nHuman guidance-based priority \nexperience replay mechanism\nEventual action 𝑎𝑎\nUpdate after use\nSorted storing \n1\n2\n3\n4\nFig. 1.

RELATED WORK\nSample efﬁciency bottlenecks the training and performance\nof RL. Combining human guidance with RL is a promising\nway to mitigate the challenge. Three categories of human\nguidance have been integrated into RL.\nThe ﬁrst one is human feedback, where the human expert’s\nprior knowledge about the task could be used to qualitatively\nor quantitatively score the RL behaviors [15]. In this man-\nner, an RL-based unmanned ground vehicle was guided to\nrun through a maze [16]. However, the feedback is high-\ndemanding on human ability and thus is no longer popular\nin recent studies.\nThe second branch is human intervention. Intervention is\na more direct manifestation of human knowledge than giving\nfeedback. RL agents are devised to reduce their conﬁdence\nin adopted actions if intervention occurs [17]. [18] employed\nreal humans to detect catastrophic actions of DQN in playing\nAtari games, where humans were required to intervene in\nthe training process to block the risk. It punished the human\nintervened scenes through the reward-shaping technique to\nprevent RL from reaching the unfavorable situations again.\nWith a similar idea, [19] devised a reward shaping-based PPO\nalgorithm and made the RL agent complete the drone driving\ntasks under human interventions. In this report, the above-\nmentioned reward shaping scheme is also adopted, and more\nimportantly, we provide a theoretical derivation and related\ndiscussion on the optimality of the human intervention-based\nreward shaping method.\nThe human demonstration is the other way to enhance RL\nperformance. For discrete-action RL, the DQfD algorithm [12]\nshaped the value function of DQN using human demonstration.\n[20] presented a double experience buffer setting to separately\nstore the RL data and human demonstrations. For more com-\nplicated RL with actor-critic architecture, the policy function is\nusually modiﬁed to be compatible with learning from demon-\nstration. The behavior cloning objective has been added to the\nobjective of the policy function to greatly improve learning\nefﬁciency, which is a milestone in the ﬁeld. In this way,\ndexterous manipulations of high degree-of-freedom robotic\narms [21]–[23] and human-level game operation [17] were\nachieved based on the state-of-the-art RL algorithms. In this\nreport, the behavior cloning objective and its associated human\nguidance-based actor-critic framework is also integrated into\nour method. However, it is not reasonable for equal treat-\nment on various demonstrations, which is adopted in existing\nmethods. First, without optimizing the utilization, small-scale\nhuman demonstrations would be submerged in the numerous\nRL-generated data. Second, human guidance is variant due to\nthe proﬁciency and status of participants, and some low-quality\nguidance can even impair RL performance. Noticeably, these\ndrawbacks are to be overcome by the proposed prioritized\nexperience utilization mechanism.\nIII. PRELIMINARIES\nIn this section, we ﬁrst introduce the notation and concept of\noff-policy actor-critic RL, and we then illustrate the prioritized\nexperience replay mechanism. All three parts in this section\nare the base for the proposed human-guidance-based RL\nalgorithm.\nA. Notation\nWe consider a standard RL setting where an RL agent\ninteracts with the controlled environment. Such an interaction\ncan be formulated as a discrete-time Markov decision process\n(MDP), deﬁned by the tuple (S, A, R, p). The state-space S\nconsists of continuous state variables s and the action space\nconstitutes continuous action variables a. R(·|s, a) : S ×A →\nr is a reward function mapping the state-action pair (s, a)\nto a deterministic reward value r. The environment dynamics\ngenerates state transition probability p(·|s, a) : S×A →P(s′)\nmapping the state-action pair (s, a) to the probability distri-\nbution over the next state s′.\nAt each time step t, the agent observes the state st ∈S\nand sends the action at ∈A to the environment, receiving\nthe feedback of a scalar reward rt and next state st+1. The\nagent’s behavior is determined by a policy π(at|st) : S →\nP(at), which maps a state to the probability distribution over\ncandidate actions. We utilize ρπ to represent the state-action\ndistribution induced by the policy π.\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021\n3\nB. Off-policy Actor-critic Architecture\nThe goal of RL is to optimize the policy which maximizes\nthe expected value V over the environment dynamics. A\nBellman value function (also called critic) is established to\nestimate V in a bootstrapping way. This value function is\nusually called Q. Under an arbitrary policy π, Q is deﬁned\nas:\nQπ(st, at) = rt + γ\nE\n(st+1,at+1)∼ρπ[Qπ(st+1, at+1)],\n(1)\nwhere γ ∈(0, 1) is the discount factor. Then the policy func-\ntion (also called actor) can be obtained concerning maximized\nQ, represented as:\nπ = arg max\nπ\n\u0014\nE\n(s,a)∼ρπ [Qπ (s, a)]\n\u0015\n,\n(2)\nIn practice, value function pursues the evaluation regarding\nonly the optimal policy π⋆, regardless of the policy executing\nthe interaction. Therefore, RL decouples the policy evaluation\nprocess and the policy’s behavior, which makes the agent\nupdate in an off-policy manner.\nWe use neural networks as the function approximator to\nformulate the actor and critic, the objectives are then reached\nthrough the loss functions. Speciﬁcally, the loss function of\nthe critic LQ, and the actor Lπ can be expressed as:\nLQ (θ) = rt + γE [Q (st+1, π (st+1; φ) ; θ)] −Q (st, at; θ) ,\n(3)\nLπ (φ) = −Q (st, π (·|st; φ) ; θ) ,\n(4)\nwhere Q(·; θ) represents the parameterized critic function and\nθ represents the parameters of the critic network, π(·; φ)\nrepresents the parameterized actor function and φ represents\nthe parameters of the actor network. Hereinafter, the parameter\nθ and φ can be omitted if no ambiguity exists.\nC. Prioritized Experience Replay Mechanism\nThe experience replay mechanism establishes an experience\nbuffer to store the data at each interaction. Accordingly, the\nRL agent can retrieve data generated by previous policies from\nthe buffer for policy evaluation and improvement.\nGiven an arbitrary time step t, the interaction between the\nRL agent and the environment generates a transition tuple,\nwhich is stored into the experience replay buffer as:\nB ←ζt = (st, at, rt, st+1).\n(5)\nConventionally, the experience in the buffer is retrieved from\nthe buffer using uniform random sampling. In a more efﬁcient\nmethod, prioritized experience replay mechanism (PER) [24],\nthe data sample is subjected to a nonuniform distribution I,\nand its probability mass function pI ∼I can be expressed as:\npI (i) =\npα\ni\nP\nk pα\nk\n,\n(6)\nwhere α ∈[0, 1] is the scaling coefﬁcient, p represents the\npriority of each tuple i, which is determined by the temporal\ndifference (TD) error δT D and expressed as:\npi = |δT D\ni\n| + ε\n= |ri + γ · Q (si+1, π (·|si+1; φ) ; θ) −Q (si, ai; θ) | + ε,\n(7)\nwhere ε ∈R+ is a small positive constant to guarantee\nthe probability larger than zero. A larger TD error indicates\nan experience worth learning to a higher extent. Thus, the\nTD error-based prioritized experience replay mechanism can\nimprove the RL training efﬁciency.\nIV. HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\nIn this section, we ﬁrst summarize the human behaviors\nin the RL training process which can be leveraged in the\nalgorithm design. Based on that, we establish an actor-\ncritic framework adapting to human guidance. Then, two\nmodules are proposed to further improve RL in the context\nof human guidance: a novel prioritized experience replay\nmechanism concerning human demonstration, and a reward\nshaping technique concerning human intervention. Finally, a\nholistic human-in-the-loop RL algorithm is instantiated using\nthe above components.\nA. Human Guidance Behavior in RL Training\nWe deﬁne two useful human guidance behaviors in the RL\ntraining process: intervention and demonstration.\nIntervention: Human participants recognize RL interaction\nscenes and identify whether a guidance behavior should be\nconducted based on their prior knowledge and reasoning\nabilities. If human participants decide to intervene, they can\nmanipulate the equipment to get the control authority (partially\nor totally) from the RL agent. The intervention generally\nhappens when the RL agent conducts catastrophic actions or\nis stuck in local optima traps. Thus, RL could learn to avoid\nunfavorable situations from the intervention.\nDemonstration: Human participants perform their actions\nwhen an intervention event happens, which generates the\ncorresponded reward signal and next-step state. The generated\ntransition tuple can be seen as a piece of demonstration data\nsince it is induced by human policy instead of the RL’s\nbehavior policy. RL algorithm could learn human behavior\nfrom the demonstration.\nState-of-the-art human-guidance-based RL algorithms have\nbeen integrating learning from intervention (LfI) [18], and\nlearning from demonstration (LfD) [25]. In this report, both\nLfI and LfD will be employed in the proposed architecture.\nSpeciﬁcally, LfI based on the reward shaping technique is\nutilized in the reward function deﬁnition, while LfD plays its\nrole in the underlying principles of the algorithm.\nB. Human-guidance-based Actor-critic Framework\nIn this section, we elaborate on the interaction mechanism\nand learning objective of the proposed human-guidance-based\nactor-critic RL algorithm.\nFirst, we focus on the interaction mechanism. In the stan-\ndard interaction between RL and environment, RL’s behavior\npolicy will output actions to explore the environment. Given\nan off-policy actor-critic RL, the above process is shown as:\naRL\nt\n= π(·|st; φ) + ξa ⊙astd\nt ,\n(8)\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021\n4\nwhere astd\nt\n∈Rdim(A) is a training-dependent variable that\nscales the exploration noise, ⊙represents the Hadamard\nproduct and ξa ∼N(0, Idim(A))\nWe give full authority to human participants whenever they\ndecided to take control in the training loop of RL. Thus, the\neventual action is ﬁltered by a mask as:\nat = (Idim(A) −∆t) · aRL\nt\n+ ∆t · aH\nt ,\n(9)\nwhere aH\nt\nrepresents the action from the human participant’s\npolicy, ∆t ∈Rdim(A) is a demonstration mask: it is an identity\nmatrix when human demonstration happens and a zero matrix\nin the non-demonstrated step.\nThe interaction transition tuple ζ will be recorded and stored\ninto the experience replay buffer once the action is sent to the\nenvironment. In particular, actions from the human policy and\nthe RL policy are stored in the same buffer. For this context,\nthe new transition tuple ζ is deﬁned to discriminate human\ndemonstrations from normal RL experiences as:\nζi = (si, ai, ri, si+1, ∆i).\n(10)\nThen, we focus on the learning objective. Given a batch of\ntransition tuples with batch size N, there could exist data ζN1\nfrom the RL policy and ζN2=N−N1 from the human policy.\nThe critic network, based on the optimal value function, can\nlearn from both policies. Thus, its loss function is calculated\nas:\nLQ(θ) =\n1\nN1\nN1\nX\ni\n∥ri + γQ(si+1, π(·|si+1); θ) −Q(si, aRL\ni\n; θ)∥2\n2\n+ 1\nN2\nN2\nX\nj\n∥rj + γQ(sj+1, π(·|sj+1); θ) −Q(sj, aH\nj ; θ)∥2\n2.\n(11)\nGiven the data from the human policy, the actor should\nlearn from these demonstrations in addition to maximizing the\ncritic’s value. Hence, we devise the loss function of the actor\nnetwork considering behavior cloning as:\nLπ (φ) = 1\nN1\nN1\nX\ni\n[−Q(si, π(·|si; φ); θ)]\n+ 1\nN2\nN2\nX\nj\n[ω · ∥aH\nj −π(·|sj; φ)∥2\n2],\n(12)\nwhere ω is a manually determined constant that weighs the\nimportance of behavior cloning.\nIt is noticeable that the mean squared error (MSE) losses\ninvolved in the above formulas are for exempliﬁed calculation,\nmeaning that they can be alternated by any loss functions.\nC. Prioritized Human Demonstration Replay\nIn this section, we put forward a novel PER mechanism for\nhuman demonstration.\nHuman demonstrations are generally more critical than most\nexploration from RL’s behavior policy due to prior knowledge\nand reasoning ability. Thus, a more effective method is needed\nto weigh human demonstrations among the buffer. We propose\nan advantage-based metric instead of TD-error of the normal\nPER to establish the prioritized replay mechanism.\nFirst, we deﬁne an advantage measure regarding the human\ndemonstration against the RL’s behavior policy. Since the\ncritic, i.e., value function, can evaluate the policy, we calculate\nthe difference between the Q value of the human action and\nthat of the RL action. Given a human-demonstration transition\ntuple (si, ai = aH\ni , ri, si+1), the priority level p is deﬁned as:\npi =\n∆|δT D\ni\n|+ε+exp\n\u0002\nQ(si, aH\ni ; θ) −Q(si, π(·|si); θ)\n\u0003\n, (13)\nwhere exp is the exponential function to guarantee the non-\nnegative advantage value.\nWe call the last term of the Eq. 13 the Q-advantage term,\nwhich evaluates to what extent should a speciﬁc human-\ndemonstration tuple be retrieved except the TD-error metric.\nThrough the RL training process, the RL agent’s ability\nvaries and the priority level of one human-demonstration tuple\nchanges accordingly, which gives rise to a dynamic priority\nmechanism. We abbreviate Q-advantage as QA and call the\nabove mechanism TDQA to illustrate it combines two metrics\nas the measurement of human guidance. The QA term is\nremoved for non-demonstration tuples when calculating the\nabove equation, thus, the priority levels of non-demonstration\ndata are aligned with those in the conventional PER.\nIn this manner, the experience in the buffer B subjects to\na distribution I′, and the probability mass function of the\nexperience distribution pI′ ∼I′ can be expressed as:\npI′(i) =\npα\ni\nP\nk pα\nk\n.\n(14)\nWe inherent the optimization trick of the conventional PER\nby using a sum-tree structure to store transition data, and the\nupdating and sampling can be conducted with a complexity of\nO(log N).\nThe priority mechanism introduces the bias to the estimation\nof the expectation of the value function since it changes the\nexperience distribution in the buffer. Biased value network Q\ncould have little impact on the RL asymptotic performance, yet\nit may affect the stability and robustness of the mature policy\nin some situations. As an optional operation, we can anneal\nthe bias by introducing the importance-sampling weight to the\nloss function of the value network. The importance-sampling\nweight of a transition i is calculated as:\nwIS(i) = [pI′(i)]−β .\n(15)\nwhere β\n∈[0, 1] is a coefﬁcient: the fully non-uniform\nsampling occurs if β = 1, and fully uniform sampling occurs\nif β = 0. β will gradually decrease to zero along with the\ntraining process.\nThe importance-sampling weight can be added to the loss\nfunction of the value network, expressed as:\nLQ(θ) =\nE\nζi∼I′wIS(i) (ri + γQ(si+1, π(·|si+1); θ) −Q (si, ai; θ))].\n(16)\nThrough the proposed PER, we prioritize human guidance\nover RL experiences. Moreover, high-quality demonstrations\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021\n5\nare prioritized to more extents, and the utilization efﬁciency\nof human demonstrations can be enhanced.\nD. Human-intervention-based Reward Shaping\nIn this section, we introduce the human-intervention-based\nreward shaping technique. Naturally, there is no need for\nhumans to provide guidance if the being-trained RL agent is\nexecuting a good policy. Therefore, to minimize the human\nworkload, we assume human participants would intervene in\nthe training process only when RL’s behaviors are unfavorable.\nIn this context, the intervention event can be seen as a negative\nsignal and the corresponding state should be avoided by RL.\nThis negative feedback can be realized by reward shaping,\nwhich will be detailed in this section.\n𝑎𝑎0\n𝑎𝑎1\n𝑎𝑎2\n𝑎𝑎3\n𝑎𝑎4\n𝑎𝑎5\n𝑠𝑠0\n𝑠𝑠1\n𝑠𝑠2\n𝑠𝑠3\n𝑠𝑠4\n𝑠𝑠5\n𝑠𝑠6\nState \nRL action (𝚫𝚫= 𝟎𝟎)\nHuman demonstration action (𝚫𝚫= 𝐈𝐈)\nIntervention time ( (𝚫𝚫𝑡𝑡= 𝐈𝐈) ∧(𝚫𝚫𝑡𝑡−1 = 𝟎𝟎) )\nFig. 2. Illustration of the intervention time step. In a time-sequential MDP,\nthe ﬁrst time step which is controlled by human demonstration is taken as the\nintervention time.\nWe ﬁrst identify the intervention event. Recall Eq. 9 deﬁnes\na mask ∆t, which is a time-sequential variable recording if\nthe action at is conducted by human demonstration. Hence,\nthe intervention time, i.e., the start time of a period of human\ndemonstrations, can be represented by (∆t = I)∧(∆t−1 = 0)\nin a time-sequential training process of RL, as illustrated in\nFig. 2. It is noted that only the intervention time is to be\npunished by the reward shaping, since the states after humans\nintervention will be substituted by human demonstrations and\ncannot be seen as unfavorable. For instance, in Fig. 2, s2 is\npenalized while s3 and s4 are not.\nThen, we can shape the vanilla reward function with an\nadditional penalized function:\nrshape\nt\n= rt + rpen[(∆t = Idim(A) ∧(∆t−1 = 0dim(A))], (17)\nwhere rshape\nt\nis the reward after shaping, rpen is a scalar that\nweighs the intervention penalty.\nThe theoretical performance of this reward shaping scheme\nis analyzed in Appendix A.\nE. Prioritized human-in-the-loop RL algorithm\nIn this section, we integrate all the above components and\npropose a holistic RL algorithm considering human guidance.\nIt is noted that although the human guidance-based actor-critic\nframework in Section IV-B and reward shaping in Section\nIV-D are components of the algorithm, they are not the major\nnovelty of this report. To highlight our core idea of the\nprioritized human-demonstration replay mechanism of Section\nIV-C, we name the proposed algorithm as Prioritized Human-\nIn-the-Loop (PHIL) RL.\nSpeciﬁcally, we obtain the holistic human-in-the-loop RL\nconﬁguration through equipping the human-guidance-based\nactor-critic framework with prioritized human-demonstration\nreplay and intervention-based reward shaping mechanisms. We\ninstantiate the PHIL algorithm based on one of the state-of-the-\nart off-policy RLs, i.e., twin delayed deep deterministic policy\ngradient (TD3) [26]. We also remind the above components\nare adaptive to various off-policy actor-critic RL algorithms.\nIn TD3, the target networks, namely, the target critic Q′\nwith parameter θ′ and target actor π′ with parameter φ′ are\nutilized to stabilize the algorithm update.

HUMAN POLICY MODEL\nIn this section, a human policy model is established in\nconjunction with PHIL-RL. The model can relieve human\nworkload in the human-in-the-loop RL process by imitating\nthe behavior policy of actual human participants.\nWe train a regression model to imitate human policy si-\nmultaneously with RL, and this policy model can substitute\nhumans when necessary. Consider human behaviors in the RL\ntraining process: the human participant is required to intervene\nin the control process when he/she believes the agent poorly\nbehaves. Human interventions are usually imposed to the loop\nin an intermittent way and demonstrations are incrementally\nsupplemented into the training set (buffer). Thus, we train the\nhuman policy model leveraging an online- and incremental-\nbased imitation learning algorithm, i.e., the Data Aggregation\n(DAgger) [27], which is free from ofﬂine large-scale collection\nof the demonstration data.\nIt is noted that the human policy model does not aim\nto accurately mimic expert-level humans. In practice, the\ncommon situation is humans who cooperate with RL are\nnon-proﬁcient, and humans’ performance can ﬂuctuate with\nmental and physical status. Thus, we do not require the model\nto achieve expert-level performance. In essence, the human\npolicy model is to provide roughly correct demonstrations for\nthe RL agent.\nDenoting the human policy model with H, the objective\nis to ﬁnd a policy πH minimizing its difference d with the\nhuman policy πH:\nπH = arg min\nπ\n\u0002\nEsi\n\u0002\nd(si, πH)\n\u0003\u0003\n.\n(24)\nWe initialize model H by replicating an untrained RL policy\nnetwork. After the ﬁrst human-intervention event, model H is\nestablished as:\nπH\n0 (ϕ) ←π(φ).\n(25)\nIn subsequent episodes, we retrieve human demonstrations to\nconduct incremental learning with the loss function:\nLH(ϕ) = E(si,aH\ni )\n\u0002\n∥aH\ni −πH(·|si; φ)∥2\n2\n\u0003\n,\n(26)\nand update the model with the gradient method as:\nπH\ne+1 ←πH\ne −lrπH · ∇ϕ LH (ϕ),\n(27)\nwhere e is the episode number of the RL process.\nThrough the above update, model H would gradually be\ncompetent to accurately mimic human policy, and accordingly,\nsubstitute human participants to assist RL. It is noticeable that\nif using this human policy model to cooperate with PHIL, the\nactivation conditions of model H shall be manually deﬁned\nvarying to speciﬁc environments.\nVI. PROBLEM FORMULATION\nThe proposed PHIL-TD3, like most RLs, can be universally\nadapted to any continuous-action decision and control tasks.\nHere we choose the end-to-end autonomous driving problem\nas the object, evaluating our algorithm in two challenging\ndriving scenarios. Note that the RL-based autonomous driving\nproblem can be solved by numerous reasonable settings, while\nthe problem formulation in this section is to provide a fair\nenvironment for algorithm evaluation and comparison.\nIn this section, two challenging autonomous driving scenar-\nios are introduced to evaluate the control and optimization\nperformance of the proposed algorithm, then the standard\noptimization setting is established.\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021\n7\nA. Autonomous Driving Scenarios\nRL is better suited to the challenging driving tasks compared\nto rule-based or model optimization-based approaches due to\nits high representational and generalization capabilities. We\nchoose two scenarios, shown in Fig. 3, to evaluate the RL\nperformance. These scenarios are challenging to conventional\nautonomous driving strategies due to complex combinatorial\nrelationships.\nUnprotected left-turn: This scenario is illustrated in Figs.\n3(a-b). The ego vehicle, i.e., the controlled vehicle, in the side\nroad is trying to make a left turn and merge into the main\nroad. No trafﬁc signals guide the vehicles in the intersection.\nWe assume the lateral path of the ego vehicle is planned by\nother techniques, while the longitudinal control is assigned to\nthe RL agent. Surrounding vehicles are initialized with varying\nrandom velocities ranging from [4, 6] m/s and controlled by\nthe intelligent driver model (IDM) [28] to execute lane-keeping\nbehaviors. All surrounding drivers are set with aggressive\ncharacteristics, meaning that they would not yield to the ego\nvehicle. The control interval for all vehicles is set as 0.1\nseconds.\nHighway congestion: This scenario is illustrated in Figs.\n3(c-d). The ego vehicle is stuck in severe congestion and\ntightly surrounded by other vehicles; thus, it is trying to shrink\nthe gap with its leading vehicles and conduct the car-following\ntask with the target velocity. We assume the longitudinal\ncontrol is completed by IDM with a target velocity of 6\nm/s, while the lateral control is assigned to the RL agent.\nSurrounding vehicles are initialized with the velocity ranging\nfrom [4, 6] m/s and controlled by IDM to execute car-\nfollowing behaviors. The control interval for all vehicles is\nset as 0.1 seconds. The crowded surrounding vehicles cover\nthe lane markings and no speciﬁc one leading vehicle in the\nego lane, which can lead the conventional lateral-planning\napproaches to be invalid in such a scenario.\nEgo vehicle\nSurrounding\nvehicles\na\nb\nEgo vehicle\nSurrounding\nvehicles\nc\ndd\nFig. 3.

State space illustration: bird’s-eye-view semantic graph. a, the left-turn\nscenario, b, the congestion scenario.\nB. RL-based problem deﬁnition\nState: : The bird-view semantic graphs are taken as the\nstate information for the RL agent, shown in Fig. 4. Two\nconsecutive frame images are used to constitute one state\nvariable to enable temporal perception. We scale the camera-\ncaptured image to a smaller size to relieve the computational\nburden. The state variable can be expressed as:\nst = {pt−1, pt|p ∈[0, 1]},\n(28)\nwhere p ∈R45×80 is a pixel matrix of which the elements are\nnormalized.\nAction: : The action variable can be either lateral or\nlongitudinal commands adaptive to different requirements. For\nthe lateral control task in the congestion scenario, we choose\nthe angle of the steering wheel as the action, expressed as:\nat = [δt|δ ∈[−5λπ, 5λπ]] ,\n(29)\nwhere δ ∈R1 is the continuous steering command, of which\nthe negative value indicates a left-turn command and the\npositive value corresponds to a right-turn command, and λ\nis the scaling factor that limits the steering range.\nFor the longitudinal control in the left-turn scenario, we\nchoose the accelerating/braking pedal aperture, expressed as:\nat = [ηt |η ∈[−1, 1]] ,\n(30)\nwhere η ∈R1 is the continuous pedal aperture, of which the\nnegative value indicates a braking command and the positive\nvalue corresponds to an accelerating command.\nReward: : The goal of an autonomous vehicle is to rapidly\ncomplete trafﬁc scenarios through safe and smooth driving\nbehaviors. RL-based driving strategy achieves this by an\nappropriate reward function deﬁnition. The reward schemes\nof the two tasks in Fig.3 can be respectively deﬁned as:\nRleft-turn (·|st, at) =rgoal · 1 (st ∈Sgoal)\n+rfail · 1 (st ∈Sfail) + rspeed (st) ,\n(31)\nRcongestion (·|st, at) =rgoal · 1 (st ∈Sgoal)\n+rfail · 1 (st ∈Sfail) + rsteer (st) ,\n(32)\nwhere rgoal = 10 and Sgoal is the set of goal states where the\nego vehicle successfully completes the scenario; rfail = −10\nand Sfail is the set of failure states where the collision\noccurs; while rspeed = −∥vego −vtarget∥is the reward that\nencourages the target speed, i.e., 5m/s set in this section;\nrsteer = ∥δt −δt−1∥is the reward that discourages frequent\nsteering behaviors. It is noticeable that both rspeed and rsteer\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021\n8\na\nb\n𝑎𝑎\nConvolutional \nlayers\nFlatten\nDense \nlayers\nState: consecutive images\nLatent feature\nOutput action\n𝑄𝑄\nConvolutional layers\nDense \nlayers\nState: consecutive images\nLatent feature\nOutput Q value\nEmbedding layer\nAction: steer/pedal signals\nFlatten\nFig. 5.\nNeural network approximator illustration. a, the policy function\narchitecture achieved by the neural network, where the target value network\nowning the same structure is omitted for brevity. b, the value network\narchitecture achieved by the neural network, where the target value network\nowning the same structure is omitted for brevity.\ncan implicitly play a role in promoting smooth driving.

When RL manipulates the steering wheel, the\nlongitudinal control is achieved by an IDM. When RL ma-\nnipulates the pedal aperture, the lateral motion target is to\ntrack the planned waypoints through a proportional-integral\n(PI) controller.\nVII. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION\nA. Baseline Algorithms\nWe employ state-of-the-art in the domain of human-involved\nRL algorithms as baselines and compare their performance\nagainst the proposed algorithm.\nIA-TD3: This baseline is derived from Intervention Aided\nReinforcement Learning (IARL) , which is a representative\ncombination of a continuous-action RL algorithm and human\ndemonstration. The RL’s policy network is modiﬁed to adapt\nto human demonstrated actions by introducing the behavior\ncloning objective. Once human intervention happens, the hu-\nman demonstration will substitute the RL’s exploratory action,\nand a penalty signal will impose on the reward value. In\nthis study, we devise a modiﬁed IARL by replacing the on-\npolicy base algorithm with TD3, which essentially augmented\nthe algorithm by improving the sample efﬁciency. We also\nimplement the prioritized experience replay (PER) in this\nbaseline for a fair comparison.\nHI-TD3: This baseline is derived from Human Intervention\nReinforcement Learning (HIRL) , which is a combination of a\ndiscrete-action RL algorithm and human demonstration. Once\nintervention happens, the human demonstration will substitute\nthe RL’s exploratory action, and a penalty signal will take on\nthe reward signal. In this study, we devise a modiﬁed HIRL by\nreplacing the discrete-action base algorithm with TD3, which\naugmented the algorithm by improving the representation and\ncontrol precision. We also implement the PER in this baseline\nfor a fair comparison.\nRD2-TD3: This baseline is derived from Recurrent Replay\nDistributed Demonstration-based DQN (R2D3), which is a\nrepresentative combination of PER mechanism and human\ndemonstration. In this study, we devise a modiﬁed algorithm\nby replacing DQN with TD3. The original R2D3 utilizes the\nrecurrent neural network to augment performance, which is not\nthe concerned technique in the context of this report, thus, we\nremove the recurrent network structure and only focus on its\nreplay distributed character regarding human demonstrations.\nThus, we devise a Replay Distributed Demonstration-based\n(RD2) TD3 algorithm, which distributes human demonstration\nand RL exploratory experience into two experience buffers\nrespectively and retrieves experiences by PER. The probability\nof utilizing human guidance instead of RL exploratory experi-\nence is aligned with the ratio of human guidance amount and\ntotal data amount.\nFurthermore, we use the vanilla PER+TD3 that is shielded\nfrom human guidance as an ablated baseline.\nB. Experimental Setting\nMultiple experiments are to evaluate the comprehensive\nperformance of PHIL-TD3 against baselines. First, the training\nefforts of involved algorithms are comparatively evaluated in\nthe two autonomous driving scenarios. Then the well-trained\nautonomous driving strategies are tested regarding control\nperformance with several metrics. Last, a series of experiments\ninvolving both training and testing stages are conducted to\nanalyze the mechanism of PHIL-TD3.\nThe training hardware comprises a driving simulator and\na high-performance workstation. The driving simulator is\nutilized to collect human data to train the human policy model\ncomplying with Section IV, and the workstation is dedicated\nto processing RL training. A high-ﬁdelity autonomous driving\nsimulation platform, CARLA [29], is employed to implement\ndriving scenarios and generate RL-environment interaction\ninformation. The schematic diagram of the RL training stage\nis illustrated in Fig. 6(a).\nThe testing hardware is a robotic vehicle. The post-trained\nRL policy is implemented on the computation platform of\nthe vehicle, which can communicate with the CARLA server\nthrough the wireless network. The on-board RL policy receives\nstate information from CARLA and sends its control command\nback to remotely complete autonomous driving tasks. The\nrobotic vehicle aims to test whether the RL policy is well-\nworked under the current onboard calculation and communi-\ncation situations. The schematic diagram of the RL testing\nstage is demonstrated in Fig. 6(b).\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021\n9\nThe detailed conﬁguration of the above experimental plat-\nform is provided in table A1. The algorithms are concreted\nbased on neural networks, of which the architecture is il-\nlustrated in Appendix A. And the hyperparameters of the\nalgorithms are also given in Appendix A.\nC. Evaluation of RL Training Performance\nIn this section, we explore whether human guidance can\nindeed improve the RL training, and further, which algorithm\ncan achieve the best learning performance given the same\nhuman guidance. Additionally, we also investigate the effects\nof human guidance in dealing with RL tasks of different\ndifﬁculties.\nTo eliminate the deviation brought by participant random-\nness and obtain repeatable results, we use the identical human\nmodel (see Section V) to mimic human guidance behaviors\nin RL training processes. We ﬁxate the sequence of random\nseeds and make the triggering conditions of human inter-\nventions invariant in all training attempts, which achieves\na fair comparison across different algorithms. Two metrics\nare employed: the average reward of the training episode\n(excluding intervention-based shaping term), and the surviving\ndistance of the ego vehicle in the training episode before a goal\nstate or failure state in Eq. 31 occurs. A higher value of both\nmetrics indicates a better learning performance.\nFig. 7 visualizes the learning performance through curves,\nrepresented with a solid line of the mean value and an error\nband of the standard deviation. We run each algorithm ﬁve\ntimes in the unprotected left-turn scenario and demonstrate\ntheir learning processes in Figs. 7(a-b).

Among the human-involved algorithms, HI-\nTD3 performs the slowest learning process suggested by\neither reward or surviving distance, and IA-TD3 exhibits a\nfaster convergence but with limited asymptotic performance.\nIn opposite, PHIL rapidly seizes the opportunity of human\nguidance and learns the best asymptotic policy. It is noticeable\nthat PHIL-TD3 achieves the best asymptotic average reward\nof the baselines in less than 50 episodes, improving the\nlearning efﬁciency by over 700%. We also run the congestion\nscenario ﬁve times for each algorithm and plot the learning\ncurves in Figs. 7(c-d). The comparable PHIL and IA-TD3\nperform better than the other two baselines when considering\nthe reward. While the metric of surviving distance further\nconﬁrms this advantage and proﬁtably differentiates the algo-\nrithm abilities. Speciﬁcally, PHIL wins the highest eventual\nscore.

In this scenario, PHIL-TD3 achieves the\nbest asymptotic average surviving distance of the baselines\nin 220 episodes, improving the learning efﬁciency by over\n120%. Overall, the results in this training session highlight the\nsigniﬁcant superiority of the proposed algorithm in learning\nperformance.\nWe further explore the learning performance of RLs with\ndifferent task difﬁculties, which gives rise to Fig. 8. The nor-\nmal setting complies with the problem deﬁnition in Section VI,\nwhich is adopted throughout the report, while the tough setting\nchanges consecutive-frame input of Eq. 28 into a single frame\ninput, impairing the temporal perception ability of RL agents.\nAt the high level, the statistical results of the normal setting\nare aligned with the trends of Figs. 7(a-d). And it is indicated\nthat the tough setting does not change the performance ranking\nof algorithms despite the degradations in different degrees. At\nthe detail level, the performance difference between the normal\nand the tough settings, i.e., the ratios in Fig. 8, can manifest\nmore algorithmic characteristics. Speciﬁcally, PHIL-TD3 and\nIA-TD3, which own the behavior-cloning objective, are less\naffected by the incomplete problem deﬁnition of the tough\nsetting, whereas HI-TD3, and vanilla TD3, which less or not\nrely on human guidance, are signiﬁcantly degraded in the same\ncondition. Despite the single-frame state in the autonomous\ndriving task is not fairly reasonable, the ﬁndings through this\ncomparison are useful. Since numerous complex real-world\ntasks are intractable to be well-deﬁned or are only partially\nobservable, the strong integration of human guidance into RL,\ne.g., behavior-cloning, can play a more remarkable role than\npure RL algorithms.\nThen, we investigate the contributions of different compo-\nnents in improving the performance of the proposed PHIL\nalgorithm. The results are provided in Appendix 1. Three com-\nponents, the behavior cloning objective of Eq. 12 of Section\nIV-B, the proposed prioritized experience replay mechanism\nof Section IV-C, and the intervention-based reward shaping\nmechanism of Section IV-D, are validated to be effective,\nrespectively. The results show that the proposed prioritized\nhuman-demonstration replay mechanism plays a crucial role\nin improving the ultimate performance.\nLast, we evaluate the computational efﬁciency. The CPU\nclock time of different algorithms is compared in table I. It\nis shown that the training time consumption of the proposed\nalgorithm is similar to that of IA-TD3. This is because the\nproposed priority calculation scheme consumes very few com-\nputational resources. In all, the proposed PHIL-TD3 greatly\nimproves the training efﬁciency and performance without\nrequiring signiﬁcantly higher computational resources.\n30\n50\n70\n90\nCongestion\nNoise-injected\nCongestion\nVariant\nCongestion\n**\n12\n16\n20\n24\nLeft-turn\nNoise-injected\nLeft-turn\nVariant  Left-turn\nPHIL-TD3 (ours)\nIA-TD3\nHI-TD3\nVanilla TD3\n***\n*\nSurviving distance (m)\nSurviving distance (m)\nb\nc\n1\n2\n3\n4\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n74\n78\n78\n72\n66\n100\n100\n100\n100\n96\n90\n88\n82\n98\n94\n88\n94\n94\n90\n90\n98\n92\n84\n86\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n100\nC\nNC\nVC\nL\nNL\nVL\nPHIL-TD3\n(ours)\nIA-TD3\nHI-TD3\nVanilla TD3\nSuccess rate (%)\n**\n*\n*\na\nFig. 9.\nHigh-level driving performance of different RL strategies under\nsix autonomous driving scenarios.

Evaluation of Testing Performance of Driving Strategies\nIn this section, the post-trained driving strategies are tested\nin terms of autonomous driving performance, adaptiveness,\nand robustness, which can further evaluate the practicality of\nthe above algorithms.\nThe zero-mean Gaussian noises, of which the standard devi-\nation is 5% of the whole control domain, are injected to output\ncommands of the driving strategies to test the robustness.\nMore types and amounts of surrounding vehicles are added to\nconstruct variant scenarios to test the adaptiveness. We conduct\n50 runs with the same sequence of random seeds for each\npost-trained strategy in each scenario. The success rate, which\nis deﬁned as the number of completed runs divided by the\ntotal attempts in the same scenario, is taken as the metric for\nevaluating the safety performance in Fig. 9(a). Our PHIL-TD3\nachieves the highest success rate in all scenarios, showing its\nsuperior task-completeness abilities. The vanilla TD3, albeit\nwith its unstable training performance, performs competitively\nlike IA-TD3 and HI-TD3 in the testing stage. Considering the\ntwo trained scenes (rows 1, 4) and noise-injected scenes (rows\n2, 5), three baseline strategies behave acceptably, nevertheless,\nthe scenario variants (rows 3, 6) signiﬁcantly degrade their\nsafety. Our PHIL, instead, maintains the highest ability regard-\nless of varying testing conditions, manifesting itself with good\nrobustness and adaptiveness.

Discussion on Prioritized Human Experience Mechanism\nIn this section, we explore the effect of PHIL-RL from three\naspects: the performance improvement by the TDQA mecha-\nnism, the merit of the single-buffer experience replay structure,\nand the algorithmic robustness to bad demonstrations.\nTDQA, as the crucial innovation of PHIL-TD3, can im-\nprove learning performance in the context of human guidance-\nbased RLs, as suggested in Sections VII-C and VII-D. More\nspeciﬁcally, it establishes a novel priority indicator to deal with\nvarious human guidance. Thus, we ﬁrst evaluate TDQA by\ncomparing different priority schemes. “Q-adv” represents the\nscheme in which the priority of human guidance is calculated\nbased only on Q-advantage. “TD”, i.e., temporal difference,\nthe scheme is inherited from the original PER method, but\nthe TD weights of human demonstrations in it are doubled to\nhighlight the human guidance in the replay buffer.\nFive learning attempts are conducted with the same se-\nquence of random seeds for each candidate, and the corre-\nsponding learning curves are in Fig. 11. We ﬁnd scheme\ncomparison in two training scenarios shows similar trends\nwhen observing results in Figs. 11(a-b) and Figs. 11(c-d). The\npure TD scheme learns faster than pure Q-advantage in both\nscenarios, yet its asymptotic scores (both reward and surviving\ndistance) are signiﬁcantly lower than those of the Q-advantage\nscheme. To be more speciﬁc, we evaluate different weigh of\n“TD” and “Q-adv” and provide the learning performance\nin Fig. 12. Under the same TD, Q-advantage is weighted\nwith three importance levels. In particular, the equal weighting\nscheme, i.e., w = 1e0, is the adopted default scheme in the\nreport, whereas the other two variants are for comparison. It is\nshown that a larger TD (w = 1e−1) makes faster convergence\nbut can lead to unfavorable asymptotic performance, while\na larger Q-advantage (w = 1e2) can achieve the same-level\nperformance as the default setting, despite sometimes slower\nlearning process. The above results, reveal the same perfor-\nmance trends as Fig. 11. That is, TD error accelerates the\nconvergence speed and Q-advantage contributes to improving\nconvergence performance.\nEssentially, these two schemes score human guidance based\non different indicators, and a better indicator can provide RL\nwith more high-quality guidance to improve learning efﬁ-\nciency. Thus, we ﬁnd TD indicator, as proved in conventional\nPER, is indeed beneﬁcial to rapidly improve performance,\nnonetheless, the Q-advantage indicator is superior to the\nTD indicator in the later stage of the training process.

To evaluate the performance of these two\nschemes under the devised autonomous driving tasks, RD2-\nTD3 is developed which utilizes TD as the indicator to\nrespectively retrieve data from two buffers. Additionally, the\nTDQA priority mechanism is ported to the RD2-TD3 setting\nforming the other variant, RD2-PHIL. Five learning attempts\nwith the same sequence of random seeds are conducted by\nRD2-TD3 and RD2-PHIL. Through learning curves in Figs.\n13(a-d), it is found that the double distributed buffer scheme,\ni.e., RD2-PHIL, fails to achieve the same level of learning\nefﬁciency as the proposed PHIL. A possible reason behind\nthis is that human guidance can only be utilized in a chunk\nway under the double-buffer setting, whereas the single buffer\nscheme of PHIL is more ﬂexible and friendly to small-scale\nhuman guidance data. The conventional RD2-TD3 is least\nfavorable, which is within expectation due to the lack of\nthe TDQA mechanism. To sum up, the results in Fig. 13\nsupport the single-buffer structure utilized in the PHIL-TD3,\nand proﬁtably suggest the effectiveness of the proposed TDQA\nmechanism.\nA general situation occurs that human guidance is not per-\nfect, and thus an unqualiﬁed human participant can sometimes\nconduct actions that are harmful to the task. We test if the un-\nfavorable guidance of the unqualiﬁed human would impair the\nlearning process, that is, evaluating the robustness to harmful\nguidance. It is noticeable that the robustness discussed here\nis distinguished from that in Section VII-D: we discuss how\nthe algorithms are affected by poor guidance instead of the\nanti-noise ability of post-trained driving strategies. The human\nintervention condition of the training stage keeps the same as\nforegoing experiments, while one-third of the demonstrations\nfrom the human model are replaced with random actions to\nsimulate non-proﬁcient human behaviors.\nPost-trained driving strategies under poor guidance are\ntested to conduct 50 runs in each scenario and are compared\nwith those under the good guidance of Fig. 9. The stacked\nbarplots in Fig. 14 provide the adversarial testing performance\nof three human-guidance-based RL algorithms under good\nand poor guidance. We take the average surviving distance\nas the metric and the less performance deterioration by poor\nguidance suggests better robustness.

IA-TD3 falls behind with a 2.1% degradation\non average in poor guidance context, while HI-TD3 is even\nimproved by an average of 3.6% extent given poor guidance.\nIntuitively, poor guidance would remarkably degrade PHIL\nand IA-TD3 since they utilize the behavior-cloning objective\nto learn from human guidance, while HI-TD3, which only\nsubstitutes partial RL explorations with human guidance, can\nbe less affected. The not-degraded HI-TD3 and most-degraded\nIA-TD3 support the above idea. Our PHIL defeating IA-TD3\nis attributed to the TDQA mechanism: Q-advantage well\naccess the quality of human demonstrations and feed more\nhigh-quality demonstrations to the RL agent; accordingly,\nthe agent learns greater from good guidance than negative\nguidance. The secondary optimization target of RL, i.e.,\ndriving smoothness, is evaluated in Fig. 15 by acceleration\ndistribution. The proposed PHIL-TD3 wins all scenarios by\nthe most favorable smoothness which further conﬁrms the\nabovementioned superiority.\nOverall, the TDQA mechanism, as the core innovation\nof the PHIL-RL algorithm, contributes to the preponderant\nlearning performance through its unique discriminatory power\non the quality of human guidance. It also improves the robust-\nness to poor guidance, which can relieve the requirement on\nthe qualiﬁcation of human guidance. Additionally, the single\nbuffer setting is more favorable than the double distributed\nbuffer scheme under autonomous driving tasks of this report.\nVIII. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we establish a human-guidance-based rein-\nforcement learning framework and propose a novel experience\nutilization mechanism of human guidance. Based on that, we\nput forward an algorithm, PHIL-TD3, aiming at improving\nalgorithmic abilities in the context of human-in-the-loop RL.\nWe also introduce a human behavior modeling mechanism\nto relieve the human workload. PHIL-TD3 is employed to\nsolve two challenging autonomous driving tasks, and its\nperformance is comparatively evaluated against state-of-the-\nart human-guidance-based RLs as well as the non-guidance\nbaseline. Three main points are obtained through experimental\nresults:\n1) The proposed PHIL-TD3 can improve the learning efﬁ-\nciency by over 700% and 120% under the adopted two situa-\ntions, respectively, and achieve remarkably higher asymptotic\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art human-guidance-\nbased RLs.\n2) The proposed PHIL-TD3 achieves the most favorable per-\nformance, robustness, and adaptiveness in a series of metrics\nunder the adopted two challenging autonomous driving tasks.\n3) The proposed TDQA mechanism prominently con-\ntributes to the advance of PHIL-TD3 and can well discriminate\nthe quality of various human guidance to relieve humans by\nless requiring on human proﬁciency.\nIn future works, the proposed algorithm is expected to\nbe transferred to a real-world ground vehicle, whereby the\neffect of human guidance on RL’s optimization and control\nperformance can be further examined in real life.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

Speciﬁcally, F is represented as:\nF(st, at, st+1) = γΦ(st+1)) −Φ(st),\n(33)\nwhere Φ : S →R is called the potential function deﬁned over\nthe state space.\nThus, the proof converts to construct potential function Φ.\nDeﬁne the potential function Φ as:\nΦ(st) =\n( rpen\nγ ,\nif st is unacceptable\n0,\notherwise.\n(34)\nThen, when humans intervene in the state st (meaning st+1\nis unacceptable), F becomes:\nF(st, at, st+1) = γΦ(st+1) −Φ(st)\n= rpen\nγ\n· γ −0 = rpen.\n(35)\nAnd when humans do not intervene the state, F becomes:\nF(st, at, st+1) = γΦ(st+1) −Φ(st) = 0 −0 = 0.\n(36)\nLumping Eqs. 35 and 36, F turns into the reward-shaping\nterm of Eq. 17, shown as:\nrshape\nt\n=rt + F(st, at, st+1)\n=rt + rpen · [(∆t = I) ∧(∆t−1 = 0)],\n(37)\nwhere [(∆t = I)∧(∆t−1 = 0)] refers to the intervention event\nof the human.\nHence, we complete the proof.\nRemark 1: Theorem 1 is established on the below assump-\ntions: humans are considered to owe invariant judgment on\nthe environment state. In this manner, the Φ can be seen as a\nstable function deﬁned in the state space.\nRemark 2: The assumption of Remark 1 is hard to be\nmaintained in practice. This is because 1) the varying mental\nand physical status of one speciﬁc human participant would\naffect its accurate judgment on the environment state; 2) the\njudgment on the environment will be varying across different\nhuman participants; 3) the state space in the context of\ndeep networks (the image-based one in our manuscript) is\nintractable to be identiﬁed by humans accurately.\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021\n15\nTABLE A1\nCONFIGURATION OF THE EXPERIMENTAL PLATFORM.\nType\nDescription\nDetails\nWorkstation\nOperation system\nUbuntu 20.04\nWorkstation\nCPU + RAM\nAMD Ryzen 3900X + 32GB\nWorkstation\nGPU\nNVIDIA RTX 2080S\nDriving simulator\nScenario software\nCARLA\nDriving simulator\nSteering wheel suit\nLogitech G29\nDriving simulator\nDisplays\nJoint heads-up monitors×3\nDriving simulator\nOther equipment\nDriver seat suit\nRobotic vehicle\nVehicle brand\nWheeled UGV-Hunter\nRobotic vehicle\nSize dimension\n1000mm × 740mm × 400mm\nRobotic vehicle\nCommunication type\nROS publisher-subscriber\nRobotic vehicle\nCalculation board\nXavier NX Dev Kit\nOther\nProgramming\nPython\nOther\nNeural network toolbox\nPytorch\nTABLE A2\nARCHITECTURE AND DETAILS OF VALUE NEURAL NETWORK (CRITIC)\nParameter\nValue\nInput (state + action) shape\n[80,45,2] + [1]\nNetwork convolution Filter feature\n[6,16] (kernel size 6 × 6)\nNetwork pooling feature\nMaxpooling (Stride 2)\nNetwork fully connected layer feature\n[256,128,64]\nTABLE A3\nARCHITECTURE AND DETAILS OF POLICY NEURAL NETWORK (ACTOR)\nParameter\nValue\nInput (state) shape\n[80,45,2]\nNetwork convolution Filter feature\n[6,16] (kernel size 6 × 6)\nNetwork pooling feature\nMaxpooling (Stride 2)\nNetwork fully connected layer feature\n[256,128,64]\nTABLE A4\nARCHITECTURE AND DETAILS OF DAGGER-BASED HUMAN POLICY\nMODEL\nParameter\nValue\nInput (state) shape\n[80,45,1]\nNetwork convolution Filter feature\n[6,16] (kernel size 6 × 6)\nNetwork pooling feature\nMaxpooling (Stride 2)\nNetwork fully connected layer feature\n[256,128,64]\nTABLE A5\nHYPERPARAMETERS FOR RL TRAINING\nType\nDescription\nDetails\nMaximum episode\nCutoff episode number of the training process\n400\nMinibatch size (N)\nCapacity of minibatch\n128\nActor learning rate\nInitial learning rate (policy/actor networks)\n5e-4\nCritic learning rate\nInitial learning rate (value/critic networks)\n2e-4\nLearning rate decay\nDelay of learning rate (per episode)\n0.996\nActivation function\nActivation function of the networks\nRelu\nInitial exploration\nInitial exploration rate of noise in ϵ greedy\n1\nFinal exploration\nCutoff exploration rate of noise in ϵ greedy\n0.05\nGamma (γ)\nDiscount factor of the Bellman equation\n0.95\nSoft updating factor\nParameter update frequency to target networks\n1e-3\nNoise scale (ϵ)\nNoise amplitude of action in TD3\n0.2\nBounding box (c)\nBounding of the exploratory action in TD3\n1\nPolicy delay (d)\nUpdate frequency of critic over actor\n1\nTABLE A6\nHYPERPARAMETERS FOR THE PER MECHANISM\nType\nDescription\nDetails\nReplay buffer size\nCapacity of PER buffer\n1e5\nPriority factor (α)\nPriority scaling factor\n0.6\nSample factor (β)\nImportance sampling correlation\n1\nOffset factor (ε)\nTiny constant avoiding zero retrieving probability\n1e-3\nTABLE A7\nHYPERPARAMETERS FOR DAGGER-BASED HUMAN POLICY MODEL.\nType\nDescription\nDetails\nLearning rate\nInitial learning rate\n1e-4\nActivation function\nActivation function of the network\nRelu\nMaximum episode\nCutoff episode number of the training process\n50\nBatch size\nCapacity of minibatch\n128\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\nTraining episode\n-3\n-2.5\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\nReward\nPHIL-TD3(ours)\nWithout Q-adv\nWithout reward shaping\nWithout behavior cloning\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\nTraining episode\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nSurviving distance(m)\nPHIL-TD3(ours)\nWithout Q-adv\nWithout reward shaping\nWithout behavior cloning\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\nTraining episode\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0.35\n0.4\nReward\nPHIL-TD3(ours)\nWithout Q-adv\nWithout reward shaping\nWithout behavior cloning\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\nTraining episode\n10\n15\n20\nSurviving distance (m)\nPHIL-TD3(ours)\nWithout Q-adv\nWithout reward shaping\nWithout behavior cloning\na\nb\nd\nc\nFig. 1.\nAblation study of the proposed algorithm. a-b, curves of training\nrewards and surviving distances in the left-turn scenario, respectively. c-d,\ncurves of training rewards and surviving distances in the congestion scenario,\nrespectively.\n",
