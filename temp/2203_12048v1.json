Pullum, DSc \nComputer Science and Mathematics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory \npullumll@ornl.gov \n \nAbstract \n \nReinforcement learning (RL) has received significant interest in recent years, due \nprimarily to the successes of deep reinforcement learning at solving many challenging \ntasks such as playing Chess, Go and online computer games. However, with the \nincreasing focus on RL, applications outside of gaming and simulated environments \nrequire understanding the robustness, stability and resilience of RL methods. To this \nend, we characterize the available literature on these three behaviors as they pertain to \nRL. We classify the quantification approaches used, determine the objectives of the \ndesired behaviors, and provide a decision tree for selecting metrics to quantify the \nbehaviors. \n \n1.  Introduction \n \nRecent literature on the robustness of machine learning models has focused almost \nentirely on the robustness of deep neural networks for imaging applications. However, at \nthe time of this study, there are no published surveys on robustness of RL. With RL use \nincreasing, especially in control systems contexts, we pursued this review. Included \nalong with robustness are stability and resilience. Stability is included because the term \nhas been used interchangeably with robustness and resilience is included because the \nterm has been used as a state beyond robustness. \n \nRL involves agents which take actions in an environment and experience at a reward for \nthose actions. The agent is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward. \nFormally, consider an agent operating over time 𝑡 ∈ {1, … , 𝑇}. At time t, the agent is in \nenvironment state st and produces an action 𝑎! ∈𝐴. The agent then observes a new \nstate st+1 and receive a reward 𝑟! ∈𝑅. The set of possible actions A can be discrete or \ncontinuous. The goal of reinforcement learning is to find a policy 𝜋(𝑎!|𝑠!) for choosing \nan action in state st to maximize a utility function or (expected return).

[252] \n \nThe objective of this manuscript is to present a systematic review of RL literature to \nidentify metrics to measure the stability, robustness and resilience of RL. We limit RL \nto general reinforcement learning and not specialized RL, such as inverse RL. We \nreviewed papers that attempted to measure or otherwise characterize the stability, \nrobustness and resilience of RL, seeking metrics for these behaviors. \n \nWe searched computer science and technical literature databases for eligible papers, \ncombining RL, the behavior terms and terms related to measuring, metrics and \nquantification. The result comprised 16,015 items, which after removal of duplications \nand extraneous material, a collection of 546 items was established. Through a process of \nelimination described in full in the paper, we reduced the set to 248 papers. We \nsystematically reviewed those 248 papers, and the results are presented in this analysis.  \n \nWe classified the papers by behavior (i.e., stability (n=76), robustness (n=169), and \nresilience (n=3)) and identified the primary domains of application as robotics, network \nsystems, power system control and vehicle/traffic control and navigation. We identified \napproaches to determining or measuring each behavior individually and those across \nbehaviors. The approaches were categorized as quantitative or theoretical and the \nquantitative approaches were further classified as being applied internally (e.g., in \ntraining) or externally (e.g., performance measures on outputs) the model. Metrics, \nPREPRINT \n \n3 \napproaches and objectives were identified for each paper surveyed. The objective \nindicates to what the metric or approach was intended to be stable, robust or resilient. \nWe close by indicating the need to define stability, robustness and resilience behaviors \nfor RL and identify the quantitative and theoretical approaches to achieve measurement \nand determination of these behaviors. \n \nThere is a rich set of domains (i.e., 53 identified in this survey) in which measurement \nof RL stability, robustness and resilience have been conducted. The domains ranged \nfrom robotics and network systems to sheep herding and fish behavior. The most \nfrequently mentioned domains include robotics, general control and network systems, \nwith numerous papers not specifying a domain. Many papers used Gym [254] and other \nenvironments for demonstration. Though the search focused on quantitative \nmeasurement of stability, robustness and resilience, theoretical approaches were \nidentified as well. The quantitative approaches were categorized as internal or external, \ndependent upon where in the model the evaluation was held. Internal measures \nquantified the performance of the training, where external measures quantified the \nultimate performance of the model. \n \nThe goal of this systematic review was to identify metrics to measure the stability, \nrobustness and resilience of RL. To initiate the search for this review, we identified \nkeywords and phrases related to reinforcement learning, the behaviors of interest \n(stability, robustness and resilience) and measurement (shown in Table 1). \n \nTable 1.

The remainder of the paper is organized as \nfollows. Section 2 describes the methods used in this systematic review. Section 3 \npresents the results of the review. Section 4 discusses the results of the review and \nintroduces a decision tree for metric selection based on the review. Section 5 provides \nsupplementary information. \n \n \nPREPRINT \n \n4 \n2.  Methods \n \nKeywords salient to RL, system behavior and measurement were identified for the \nresearch topic and are shown in Table 1. The typical search was of the form \n \n<Key Phrase> + <Behavior> + <Measurement> \n \nwith <Key Phrase>, <Behavior> and <Measurement> defined in Table 1.  A specific \nexample is  \n \n“reinforcement learning” AND robust* AND (“metric” OR “measure” OR “index” OR \n“score” OR “quantifier” OR “indicator”) \n \nMultiple searches were conducted in bibliographic databases covering the broad areas of \ncomputer science, physical and biological sciences and engineering. See Table 12 for a \nlist of information sources used in this study. No restrictions were placed on the \npublication’s date or language. Journal articles, books, books in a series, book sections \nor chapters, edited books, theses and dissertations, conference papers, and technical \nreports containing the keywords and phrases were included in the search. The \npublication date of search results returned are bound by the dates of coverage of each \ndatabase and the date on which the search was performed, however all searches were \ncompleted by October 31, 2020. The range of dates for the documents ultimately \nincluded in the review was 2002-2020. \n \nThe databases queried resulted in 16,015 citations being collected. Irrelevant citations \nwere also unwittingly retrieved. We removed extraneous studies resulting in a collection \nof 699 publications. Further, removing duplicate papers resulted in 580 publications. \nCitations for “Full Conference Proceedings” were removed if relevant paper(s) within \nthe associated conference were otherwise collected, resulting in 546 publications. Further \nrefinement excluded publications that were not on RL, that were not on the searched \nbehavior or those that had no metrics or theoretical content, resulting in 248 \ndocuments. As a result, we systematically reviewed 248 papers and the results are \npresented in this analysis. See Figures 10, 11, and 12 for graphic summaries of the data \nreduction methodology for stability, robustness and resilience behaviors, respectively. \nSee Table 13 for a tabular summary of the data reduction. In addition, see Checklist 1 \nfor the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-\nAnalyses) guidelines used for the evaluation of the papers.  \n \nPREPRINT \n \n5 \nThe 248 papers that made it through the screening process were grouped by the \nbehavior searched, that is Stability, Robustness, and Resilience. We also identified those \npapers on one behavior that mention one or both of the other behaviors. Some papers \nthat mentioned other behaviors did so interchangeably. For instance, stability and \nrobustness were used interchangeably in several papers, which can lead to some of the \nconfusion that exists in the definitions of these behaviors. The primary domains of \napplication were identified and categorized as robotics, network systems, general control \nsystems and Gym [254] and other environments. We also identified those publications \nthat mentioned the RL policy. \n \nThe primary focus of the paper is to identify approaches to determining or measuring \neach behavior. Of course, most of the publications focused on quantitative approaches \nbecause of the search terms used. The ones that use a theoretical approach provide \nadditional insight into the behavior determination problem. The quantitative \napproaches were further classified as being applied internal (e.g., in training) or external \n(e.g., performance measures on outputs) the model. Metrics, approaches and objectives \nwere identified for each paper surveyed (see Figure 1). The objective indicates to what \nthe metric or approach was intended to be stable, robust or resilient. \n \nThere is little agreement on the definitions of stability, robustness and resilience in the \nliterature. In fact, there are few distinct definitions of these behaviors. For this review, \nwe use the following definitions. \n \nStability is a property of the learning algorithm (that is, a small change in the training \nset results in a similar model) and refers to the ranking of the variance of a model [253]. \nFor example, if we use variance of the loss function over all datasets as a performance \nmeasure and test a set of models. The smallest loss indicates the more stable model. \nGiven this definition, stability analysis is the application of sensitivity analysis to \nmachine learning. \n \nRobustness, when used with respect to computer software, refers to an operating \nsystem or other program that performs well not only under ordinary conditions but \nalso under unusual conditions that stress its designers’ assumptions \n(http://www.linfo.org/robust.html). Robustness then is a property of the model and is \nmeasured by the, e.g., loss over all datasets (as opposed to the variance of the loss). \n \nPREPRINT \n \n6 \nThroughout the literature, resilience has been used interchangeably with robustness, \nhowever, it is used most often with production machine learning systems to indicate \nrobustness to different data sets and different data added to the data set. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Categorization and resulting metrics, approaches and objectives \n \n \n3.  Results and Analysis \n \nThe publications were categorized by behavior (see Table 2): Stability (n=76), \nRobustness (n=169), and Resilience (n=3). Papers on one behavior often mention the \nother behaviors, especially Stability and Robustness (see Figure 2). Resilience is \nmentioned in 5 Stability papers and in 11 Robustness papers. Robustness is mentioned \nin 50 Stability papers and in 1 Resilience paper. Stability is mentioned in 104 \nRobustness papers and in all (3) Resilience papers. \n \nTable 2.

The term “adversarial” is mentioned in a quarter (n=61, N=248) of the papers \nreviewed (see Figure 3). That is, 1 Resilience paper, 56 Robustness papers and 4 \nStability papers mention “adversarial”. Some papers on one behavior used one of the \nother behaviors interchangeably, notably stability and robustness, specifically [91, 93, \n105, 145, 146, 179, 194, 225, and 237] and generally in several other articles. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.

Internal quantitative approaches \nmeasure aspects within the model, e.g., its training and associated measures such as the \nvalue of rewards over time or the number of episodes until convergence. External \nquantitative approaches measure performance-related aspects of the model, e.g., \nvariations in accuracy or throughput. Most (n=141, 63.2%) of the quantitative \napproaches were categorized as performance-related, or external, measures. Of these, \nmost (n=103) were on robustness, with stability (n=36) next. The 3 papers on resilience \nPREPRINT \n \n16 \nfocused on performance-related quantitative measures. Robustness also led the internal \napproaches (n=68) with stability following (n=14). These are primarily due to the large \nnumber of robustness papers (n=170) and paucity of resilience papers (n=3) overall. Of \nthe robustness papers, 40.0% (n=68) contained internal quantitative measures and \n60.6% contained external quantitative measures. For stability, these values are 18.2% \nand 46.8%, respectively. \n \nTable 6.

These are metrics specifically made \nPREPRINT \n \n17 \nto measure stability other than by the variance of the output. They essentially measure \nvariation in training performance. The vast majority (n=75, 88.2%) of the internal \nquantitative approaches calculate reward- or score-based metrics. Other types of \ninternal quantitative approaches include 2 each of policy entropy, variations in control \nstrategy approximation weights, and the convergence rate, and 1 each of policy weight, \ncalculation of the Lyapunov stability criteria and calculation of the Wasserstein function \nlower bound. The term convergence, in RL context, refers to the stability of the learning \nprocess (and the underlying model) over time [11]. \n \n \nTable 7.

The next category (n=28) of \nquantitative metrics used error, failure and success rates. Statistics on the performance \nof the tracking or estimation error follows with n=23 papers. Papers in the network \ndomain used network-related metrics (n=15) to measure the behavior. Statistics on \nprecision, accuracy and recall (n=12) followed. Five papers used variance in loss or \nregret estimation, 3 papers used game-related performance measures to quantify \nbehavior and 2 papers each used bounds on or the size of the stability region and \nterminal wealth and inventory. Eighteen (18) additional different types of external \nquantitative metrics categories were represented by a single paper each. \n \n3.3.4 Quantitative Approach Objectives \n \nAn additional aspect reviewed was to what action or event were the quantitative \napproaches attempting to be stable, robust or resilient. We call this the <behavior> \nobjective. The <behavior> objective category (see Table 9) with the highest number of \ncitations was geared toward handling changes in the operational environment or a \ndynamic environment or network (n=41). Papers that did not specifically state their \nobjective comprised the next most populous category (n=35). The objective of handling \nuncertainty and disturbances in the environment also contained n=35 papers. The \nremaining objectives included input variation/perturbations (n=20); differences between \ntraining and test or operational environments (n=19); differences or uncertainties in \nmodel parameters (n=16); adversarial attack (n=14); different domains, environments \nor settings (n=8); errors or failures in operational environment (n=5); differences in \ntraining data sets or initializations (n=5); high variability (n=2) and one paper each in \nsystematic pressure, spamming, incomplete data, and unknown control coefficients. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPREPRINT \n \n19 \nTable 8.

Theoretical approaches were dominated by \nthe use of Lyapunov stability theory. We further characterized the objectives of the \nstability, robustness and resilience behaviors. Quantitative approaches to measuring the \nbehavior focused on the ability to handle differences in the operational environment, \nwhereas the vast majority of theoretical approaches to determining the behavior did not \nspecifically state an objective. However, the objective of the theoretical approaches can \nPREPRINT \n \n28 \nbe implied by the use of Lyapunov stability theory, that is, to prove the stability of the \nsystem. Lyapunov was used regardless of whether the article was on stability or \nrobustness. \n \n \n \nFigure 8. Theoretical <behavior> objectives \n \n \nAs an aid to deciding which metric to use, we developed a decision tree based on the \ninformation obtained in this literature review. It is a collapsible tree so that branches \nare not exposed unless selected and open branches can be closed or collapsed. There are \nseveral levels in the decision tree, starting with the i) behavior (stability, robustness or \nresilience); ii) the domain (see Table 3); iii) a list of quantitative and theoretical \nobjectives (see Tables 9, 11); iv) the next level divides the metrics into external, internal \nand theoretical metrics (see Tables 5, 6); and v) the last level, i.e., the leaves, is the set \nof metrics for that branch of the decision tree (see Tables 7, 8). For example, suppose \nwe want to find a suitable metric to measure robustness of a control system that is \nexpected to face changes in the operational environment. From the metric decision tree \nshown in Figure 14, we see that the first selection is for a robustness metric. This \nselection displays the domains in which robustness metrics were described. Selecting the \nGeneral Control domain reveals 5 quantitative objectives and 4 theoretical objectives, \nincluding the objective “Changes in the Operational Environment” in both the \nquantitative and theoretical objectives. An external metric found in the literature for \nthis case is “blood glucose response” which is not applicable for this control system. The \nmore appropriate metrics and approaches are Lyapunov stability theory and calculation, \n55%\n13%\n9%\n8%\n6%\n9%\nNot specifically stated\nOperational environment\ndynamics and uncertainties\nDifferences/uncertainties in\nmodel parameters\nAdversarial attack,\ncorruption, perturbations\nError, failure\n1-2 citations each\nPREPRINT \n \n29 \nsize of the stability region and value-based guarantees.

Supporting Information \n \nThe databases in Table 12 were readily available to the author through Oak Ridge \nNational Laboratory library subscriptions. Databases selected for this study are \ninternational in scope and ensure we investigate relevant studies that are global and \nPREPRINT \n \n30 \ncover a wide range of application domains, thereby eliminating the risk of bias from the \nauthor subject matter expertise and a Western perspective. However, we are bound by \nthe content of these databases. \n \nMany abstracting and indexing databases have very broad coverage, which results in \nindividual databases duplicating content found in others. Duplicated bibliographic \nrecords were identified and removed. After duplicate entries were removed, the \nremaining citations were reviewed for completeness in terms of information needed to \nobtain the document from a library. If the citation did not include this information \n(e.g., author name(s), article title, and journal name), the missing information was \nobtained from the source database or other online sources and the citation was manually \ncorrected. \n \n \nTable 12.
