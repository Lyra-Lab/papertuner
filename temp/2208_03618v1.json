INTRODUCTION\nTerahertz (THz) communication (THzCom) has been envisioned as a key wireless technology\nin the sixth-generation (6G) and beyond era [1]. The THz band has enormous potential to support\ntera-bits-per-second (Tbps) data rates and massive connections in 6G networks, due to the tens\nup to a hundred GHz bandwidth [2]. Thanks to the recent advancements in manufacturing THz\ntransceivers and antennas, as well as the experimental licenses (95 GHz–3 THz) opened by the\nUS Federal Communications Commission, increasing endeavors have been devoted to the design\nand development of practical THzCom systems over the past few years [3].\nDespite the promise, THzCom encounters unique challenges that are different from those expe-\nrienced at lower frequencies, e.g., severe spreading loss, higher channel sparsity, and the unique\nmolecular absorption loss [4]. The molecular absorption loss is frequency-dependent, divides\nthe whole THz band into several ultra-wide transmission windows, and introduces substantially\nvarying distance-dependent path loss within transmission windows. These challenges need to be\nwisely tackled for developing practical THzCom systems.\nThere have recently been increasing endeavors to exploring novel and efﬁcient THz spectrum\nallocation strategies, e.g., [2], [4], [5], due to its beneﬁts of exploiting the potentials of the THz\nband. Speciﬁcally, multi-band-based spectrum allocation is envisioned as one promising solution\nto supporting micro- and macro-scale THzCom systems, since it can effectively assign spectral\nresources when the variation in molecular absorption loss among the users in multiuser systems\nis very high [6]. In this allocation, the spectrum of interest is divided into non-overlapping\nsub-bands, and the sub-bands are utilized to support the users in the system.\nAlthough different designs have been proposed to optimize the performance of multi-band-\nbased spectrum allocation, e.g., [6]–[9], they all considered the spectrum of interest is divided into\nsub-bands with equal bandwidth. It is noted that the consideration of equal sub-band bandwidth\n(ESB) can lead to high variation in the molecular absorption loss among the sub-bands. Different\nfrom ESB, adaptive sub-band bandwidth (ASB), where the spectrum of interest is divided into\nsub-bands with unequal bandwidths, can effectively reduce the variation in molecular absorption\nloss among the users, thus leading to an overall improvement in the data rate performance.\nMotivated by this, the multi-band-based spectrum allocation with ASB was ﬁrst proposed in our\nprevious studies [10], [11]. We note that the design in [10] is only applicable when the molecular\nabsorption coefﬁcient within the to-be-allocated spectrum is simple such that it can be modeled\n3\nas a piecewise exponential function of frequency with minimal approximation errors. In many\nspectrum regions within the THz band, the molecular absorption coefﬁcient varies in a highly\nnon-linear manner; thus, it cannot be modeled as a piecewise exponential function of frequencies\nin such spectrum regions. It follows that the designs in [10], [11] cannot be adopted in such\nspectrum regions. This motivates the current work.\nIn the current work, we study multi-band-based spectrum allocation with ASB to improve\nthe spectral efﬁciency of THzCom systems. We formulate an optimization problem to de-\ntermine the optimal sub-band bandwidth and optimal transmit power. We then propose an\nunsupervised learning-based approach to obtaining a near-optimal solution to the formulated\noptimization problem. In the proposed approach, we ﬁrst train a deep neural network (DNN)\nwhere a loss function inspired by the Lagrangian of the formulated optimization problem is\nused. Thereafter, using the trained DNN, we approximate the near-optimal solution to the\nformulated optimization problem. Using numerical results, we demonstrate that when the values\nof the molecular absorption coefﬁcient within the spectrum of interest can be modeled as\nan exponential function of frequency, the data rate obtained by our proposed unsupervised\nlearning-based approach converges to the optimal data rate achieved by the existing spectrum\nallocation approach with ASB. We also demonstrate that when the values of the molecular\nabsorption coefﬁcient within the spectrum of interest change rapidly and thus cannot be modeled\nas an exponential function of frequency, our proposed unsupervised learning-based approach\noutperforms the existing approach.\nNotations: Matrices and column vectors are denoted by uppercase and lowercase boldface\nsymbols, respectively.

SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION\nWe consider a three-dimensional (3D) indoor THzCom system where the high data rate\ndemands of nI users are supported by a single AP. We consider that the users are stationary\nand distributed uniformly on the ﬂoor in the indoor environment. We denote d as the nI × 1\n4\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n10-1\n100\n101\nFig. 1. Illustration of (i) PACSRs and NACSRs that exist between 0.5 THz and 1 THz with {TW1, TW2}, {srp1, srp2}, and\n{srn1, srn2} denoting the transmission windows, PACSRs, and NACSRs, respectively, and (ii) sub-band arrangement within\nthe spectrum of interest.\ncommunication distance vector of the AP-user channels. For notational convenience, we consider\nthat the elements in d are ordered such that d1 < d2 < · · · < dnI.\nA. THz Spectrum\n1) Spectrum of Interest: We deﬁne the regions which generally exhibit an decreasing and\nincreasing molecular absorption coefﬁcient behaviour within an ultra-wideband THz transmission\nwindow as the negative absorption coefﬁcient slope region (NACSR) and the positive absorption\ncoefﬁcient slope region (PACSR), respectively, as depicted in Fig. 1 [10]. It is noted that at the\nTHz band, the available bandwidths in each NACSR and PACSR are in the order of tens of GHz\n[10, Table 1]. Considering this, we focus on the scenario where the to-be-allocated spectrum\nof interest fully exists in either an NACSR or a PACSR of a THz transmission window in this\nwork1. Without loss of generality, in the rest of the paper, we present spectrum allocation in an\nNACSR only since this spectrum allocation can be easily applied to a PACSR.\nWe focus on multi-band-based spectrum allocation with ASB. Thus, we divide the spectrum\nof interest into nS sub-bands that are of unequal bandwidths. We denote b and f as the nS × 1\n1To fully utilize the potentials of the huge available bandwidths at the THz band, it would be more beneﬁcial to focus\non resource allocation when the to-be-allocated spectrum of interest spans across multiple NACSRs and/or PACSRs. This\nconsideration will be addressed in our future work.\n5\nvectors of the bandwidth and the center frequency of the sub-bands, respectively. For notational\nconvenience, we label the sub-bands such that f1 < f2 < · · · < fnS, as shown in Fig. 1. Thus,\nwe have\nfs = ǫf +\nXs−1\nk=1 bk + 1\n2bs = Asb + ǫf,\n(1)\nwhere s ∈{1, 2, · · · , nS} and ǫf is the start frequency of the spectrum of interest, as shown\nin Fig. 1. Here, A is an nS × nS matrix with A = LnS −1\n2InS. Considering this, we have\nf = Ab + 1nIǫf. Due to the consideration of ASB, we have\n0 ⪯b ⪯bmax,\n(2)\nwhere bmax denotes the upper bound on bandwidth of the sub-band. We then denote btot as the\ntotal available bandwidth within the spectrum of interest and express it as\nbtot = 1T\nnSb.\n(3)\n2) Sub-band Assignment: In the considered system, we assume that the users in the system\nare served by separate sub-bands2. This assumption is made to (i) ensure the data transmission to\nbe free of intra-band interference and (i) eliminate the signal processing overhead and hardware\ncomplexity caused by frequency reuse in the system, which is also adopted in [6]–[8], [10],\n[11]. Considering this assumption, we set the total number of sub-bands within the spectrum of\ninterest to be equal to the total number of users in the system, i.e., nS = nI. Also, following [6],\n[8], [9], we adopt distance-aware multi-carrier (DAMC)-based sub-band assignment to improve\nthe throughput fairness among users. The DAMC-based sub-band assignment assigns (i) the sub-\nbands with high absorption coefﬁcients to the users with shorter distances and (ii) the sub-bands\nwith low absorption coefﬁcients to the users with longer distances.\nB. Achievable Data Rate\nWe denote r as the nS×1 rate vector of users. Considering spreading and molecular absorption\nlosses experienced by THz signal propagation, we obtain the rate achieved in the sth sub-band\nas [12]\nrs =\nZ fs+ 1\n2bs\nfs−1\n2bs\nlog2\n\u0012\n1 + ps̺e−k(f)ds\nf 2d2sbs\n\u0013\ndf,\n(4)\n2A higher spectral efﬁciency can be achieved by utilizing sub-band reuse during spectrum allocation, which will be considered\nin our future work.\n6\nwhere ̺ ≜GAGUN−1\n0\n\u0000 c\n4π\n\u00012, GA and GU are the antenna gains at the AP and users, respectively,\nN0 is the noise power density, c is the speed of light, and k(f) is the molecular absorption\ncoefﬁcient at f. Furthermore, p denotes the nS × 1 transmit power vector.\nIn this work, we focus on the line-of-sight (LoS) rays of THz signals [10]–[13]. This is\nreasonable because when THz signals propagate, the direct ray dominates the received signal\nenergy, while the non-line-of-sight rays are signiﬁcantly attenuated due to high scattering and\nreﬂection losses. Also, we omit the impact of fading in the THz channel as the prior studies at\nthe THz band [10]–[13]. Moreover, following [6]–[9], [11], we omit the impact of blockages\nin the THz channel. Finally, the impact of inter-band interference (IBI) is not considered in\nthis work since prior studies have proposed designs to suppress IBI with minimal throughput\ndegradation [14].\nC. Optimal Spectrum Allocation\nWe now design an efﬁcient spectrum allocation strategy to harness the potential of the THz\nband. To this end, we study spectrum allocation with ASB to maximize the achievable data\nrate under given sub-band bandwidth and power constraints. Mathematically, this problem is\nformulated as\nPo :\nmax\np,b\nE(d, p, b)\n(5a)\ns. t.\n1T\nnSp ⩽ptot,\n(5b)\n0 ⪯p ⪯pmax,\n(5c)\n1T\nnSb = btot,\n(5d)\n0 ⪯b ⪯bmax.\n(5e)\nIn Po, E(d, p, b) is the objective function of the considered data rate maximization strategy. In\nthis work, we consider proportionally-fair data rate maximization, which leads to E(d, p, b) =\n1T\nnS log(r). Moreover, (5b) and (5c) are the power budget at the AP and the upper bound on the\npower allocated to each user, respectively. Furthermore, the justiﬁcations on (5d) and (5e) are\ngiven by (3) and (2), respectively.\nWe note that it is extremely difﬁcult, if not impossible, to analytically solve Po using the\ntraditional optimization techniques [15]. This is due to the difﬁculty in obtaining a tractable\nexpression for rs in terms of the design variables b. On one hand, obtaining rs as per (4)\n7\nFig. 2. Illustration of the general architecture of the DNN when L = 4 and nS = 3.\ninvolves an integral, the limits of which depend on b. On the other hand, the values of k(f) for\nall frequencies within the spectrum of interest are required to obtain rs. However, there does not\nexist a tractable expression that maps f to k(f) for all spectrum regions within the THz band.\nTo tackle these challenges, we resort to unsupervised learning to obtain near-optimal solution to\nPo [16], [17], and present the solution in Section III.\nIII. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING-BASED SOLUTION\nIn this section, we present an unsupervised learning-based approach to solving problem Po\nin (4). In this approach, we ﬁrst employ an ofﬂine training phase to train a DNN, utilizing (i)\na loss function which is inspired by the objective function of the dual problem of Po and (ii)\na batch of realizations of distance vectors. Thereafter, during the implementation phase, we use\nthe trained DNN to approximate the optimal solution to Po for the given distance vector. Next,\nwe will discuss the architecture of the adopted DNN in Section III-A, and the unsupervised\nlearning model used in the training phase in Section III-B.\nA. Architecture of DNN\nThe general architecture of the adopted DNN is presented in Fig. 2. The DNN consists of L\nfully-connected layers with multiple neurons in every layer. Each neuron in the network contains\na linear operation, which is followed by a point-wise nonlinearity, also known as an activation\nfunction. Considering this, the output of the network, y, is expressed as a non-linear function\nto the input of the network, x, which is given by\ny = N (x, Θ) = g(L) \u0000g(L−1) \u0000· · · g(1) (x)\n\u0001\u0001\n.\n(6)\n8\nFig. 3. Block diagram representation of the unsupervised learning model. Here, B˜p(k) and B˜b(k) are the batches of ˜p and ˜b\nobtained as the output of DNN at the kth iteration, and Φ = {B˜p(k), B˜b(k), Θ(k), λ(k)} denotes the cache of the unsupervised\nlearning model.\nHere, Θ = {̟(ℓ), β(ℓ), ℓ∈{1, 2, · · · , L}}, denotes the set of parameters (i.e., weights and\nbiases) of the DNN, and ̟(ℓ) and β(ℓ) are the weights vector and the bias of the ℓth layer,\nrespectively. Also, we have\ng(ℓ)(ρ) = σ(ℓ) \u0000(̟(ℓ))Tρ + β(ℓ)\u0001\n,\n(7)\nwhere σ(ℓ)(·) is the activation function of the ℓth layer.\nDuring the implementation phase, we provide d as the input to the DNN and obtain the output\nas the approximated values of the optimization variables of Po, which are denoted by ˜p and ˜b.\nTherefore, we have\nx = d\nand\ny =\n\n˜p\n˜b\n\n.\n(8)\nB. Unsupervised Learning Model\nThe block diagram representation of the unsupervised learning model used in the training\nphase is depicted in Fig. 3. The unsupervised learning model takes a batch of realization of\nthe distance vector, Bd, as the input, and delivers the trained Θ as the output. We note that the\nunsupervised learning model iteratively updates Θ to ensure the best mapping being obtained\nbetween Bd and the near-optimal solution to Po for the given Bd.\n9\n1) Loss Function: The loss function of the unsupervised learning model is inspired by the\nobjective function of the dual problem of Po. Speciﬁcally, the dual problem of Po is given by\nPo\nD : max\nλ,Γ\nmin\np,b Lo\n(9a)\ns.t.\n(5b) −(5e)\nλ, Γ ⪰0,\n(9b)\nwhere\nLo = Lo(d, p, b, λ, Γ)\n= −E(d, p, b) + λ1\n\u00001T\nnSp −ptot\n\u0001\n+ λ2\n\u00001T\nnSb −btot\n\u0001\n+ΓT\n1(0−p)+ΓT\n2(p−pmax)+ΓT\n3(0−b)+ΓT\n4(b−bmax)\n(10)\nis the Lagrangian of Po, and λ = [λ1, λ2]T and Γ = [Γ1, Γ2, Γ3, Γ4] are the Lagrange\nmultipliers associated with the constraints of Po. In our unsupervised learning model, p and\nb are approximated as ˜p and ˜b using the DNN, respectively, which is parameterized by Θ.\nConsidering this, the problem Po\nD can be regenerated into the following variable optimization\nas\nˆPo :\nmax\nλ\nmin\nΘ\nˆL\n(11a)\ns.t. (5b), (5d)\nλ ⪰0,\n(11b)\nwhere\nˆL = ˆL(d, ˜p, ˜b, λ)\n= −E(d, ˜p, ˜b)+λ1\n\u00001T\nnS˜p−ptot\n\u0001\n+λ2\n\u0010\n1T\nnS ˜b−btot\n\u0011\n.\n(12)\nIn (12), ˆL is obtained as a simpliﬁed version of Lo given in (10). This is because the satisfaction\nof constraints (5c) and (5e) can be guaranteed by carefully choosing appropriate activation\nfunctions for the neurons in the Lth (or the output) layer of the DNN, e.g., σ(L)(·) = ϑ × S(·),\nwhere S(·) is the sigmoid function, and ϑ = pmax and ϑ = bmax for the ﬁrst and the second nS\nneurons of the output layer, respectively.\nWe note that the optimal value of Po\nD might be a loose global lower bound on the optimal\nvalue of Po, since Po is not a convex optimization problem. However, we also note that the\n10\ndesign variables of Po\nD are approximated using a DNN in our unsupervised learning model and\nˆPo aims to optimize the DNN parameters, Θ. Thus, it can be concluded based on the universal\napproximation theorem that the optimal value of ˆPo provides a tight lower bound on the optimal\nvalue of Po [16], [17]. Based on this conclusion and considering that a batch of realization of d,\nBd, is used during the training phase, we deﬁne the loss function of the unsupervised learning\nmodel, J . Speciﬁcally, for each realization of d in Bd, we obtained the corresponding ˆL, and\nthen derive J as the mean of ˆL values. Mathematically, J is obtained as\nJ = J (Θ, λ) = 1\nnT\nX\nd∈Bd\nˆL,\n(13)\nwhere nT is the total number of realization of d in Bd. We then iteratively update Θ and λ with\nthe objective of minimizing J to arrive at the near-optimal solution to Po.\n2) Updating Θ and λ: The DNN parameters, Θ, are updated according to\nΘ(k+1) = Θ(k) −δΘ ∇Θ(k)J (k)\n= Θ(k) −δΘ\nnT\nX\nd∈Bd\nh\n∇Θ ˆL\ni\nΘ=Θ(k),˜p=˜p(k),\n˜b=˜b(k),λ=λ(k)\n(14)\nwhere δΘ is the learning rate and Ψ(k) is the kth iteration value of Ψ, with Ψ ∈{Θ, J , ˜p, ˜b, λ}.\nConsidering the chain rule, we express ∇Θ ˆL in (14) as\n∇Θ ˆL = ∇Θy\n\n∇˜p ˆL\n∇˜b ˆL\n\n\n(15)\nIn (15), ∇˜p ˆL and ∇˜b ˆL can be derived as\n∇˜p ˆL = −∇˜pE(d, ˜p, ˜b) + λ1,\n(16)\nand\n∇˜b ˆL = −∇˜bE(d, ˜p, ˜b) + λ2,\n(17)\nrespectively. Note that in (16) and (17), it is impossible to analytically derive ∇˜pE(d, ˜p, ˜b)\nand ∇˜bE(d, ˜p, ˜b), respectively. Hence, we numerically calculate the values of ∇˜pE(d, ˜p, ˜b) and\n∇˜bE(d, ˜p, ˜b) when ˜p = ˜p(k) and ˜b = ˜b(k) by using\nh\n∇˜pE(d, ˜p, ˜b)\ni\n˜p=˜p(k),\n˜b=˜b(k)\n=E(d, ˜p(k)+ε˜p(k), ˜b)−E(d, ˜p(k), ˜b)\nε˜p(k)\n,\n(18)\n11\nand\nh\n∇˜bE(d, ˜p, ˜b)\ni\n˜p=˜p(k),\n˜b=˜b(k)\n=E(d, ˜p(k), ˜b+ε˜b(k))−E(d, ˜p(k), ˜b)\nε˜b(k)\n,\n(19)\nrespectively, where ε is a very small positive number. We also note that in (15), ∇Θy can be\ncalculated as a function of Θ(k) utilizing the chain rule.\nAs for the Lagrangian multiplier, λ, it can be updated according to\nλ(k+1)=\nh\nλ(k) + δλ ∇λ(k)J (k)i+\n=\n\"\nλ(k)+ δλ\nnT\nX\nd∈Bd\nh\n∇λ ˆL\ni\n˜p=˜p(k),˜b=˜b(k)\n#+\n,\n(20)\nwhere δλ is the learning rate. In (20), ∇λ ˆL can be derived as\n∇λ ˆL =\n\n1T\nnS ˜p −ptot\n1T\nnS ˜b −btot\n\n.\n(21)\nFinally, we note that based on (14) and (20), we can iteratively update Θ and λ in the unsuper-\nvised learning model.\nIV. CONVEX OPTIMIZATION-BASED SOLUTION FOR A SPECIAL CASE\nAs mentioned in Section III, it is impossible to analytically solve the spectrum allocation prob-\nlem Po using traditional optimization techniques for the generalized system model considered in\nthis work. Despite so, for a special case of the considered system model, the solution to Po can\nbe obtained using the convex optimization theory and standard convex problem solvers [10],\n[11]. We next present this special case system and its solution using convex optimization,\nthe performance of which will be used as a benchmark in Section V for demonstrating the\neffectiveness and beneﬁts of our proposed approach in Section III.\nIn the considered special case system, the molecular absorption coefﬁcient within the spec-\ntrum of interest, k(f), can be modeled as an exponential function of frequency with minimal\napproximation errors. We note that there indeed exist PACSRs and NACSRs within the THz\nband where k(f) can be modeled as an exponential function of frequency, e.g., between 0.771\nand 0.821 THz, where the maximum modeling approximation error is 5%.\nFor the considered special case system, the data rate, rs, can be approximated as a tractable\nexpression in terms of b. Speciﬁcally, by modeling k(f) within NACSRs as an exponential\nfunction of frequency, we can approximate k(f) as\nk(f) = eη1+η2f + η3,\n(22)\n12\nwhere η = [η1, η2, η3]T is the model parameter vector. This enables us to obtain rs as a tractable\nexpression of b as\nrs = bs log2\n \n1 + ps̺e−ds(eη1+η2(Asb+ǫf )+η3)\nbsd2\ns(Asb + ǫf)2\n!\n.\n(23)\nWith the simpliﬁed expression rs in (23), although Po becomes tractable, it is still non-convex.\nTo overcome the non-convexity, we consider the following substitution for b, given by\nb = ξ1 + ξ2 log(ξ3z),\n(24)\nwhere z is the nS × 1 new design variable vector that would replace b in the optimization\nproblem and ξ = [ξ1, ξ2, ξ3]T is a vector with real constants as its elements. Using (24), the\nspectrum allocation problem for the special case system can be transformed into an equivalent\nstandard convex problem given by\nˆPo\nSC :\nmin\np,z\n−1T\nnS log(r)\n(25a)\ns. t.\n(5b), (5c),\nnS\nY\ns=1\nzξ2\ns −ztot ⩽0,\n(25b)\nzmin ⪯z ⪯zmax,\n(25c)\nwhere ztot = (ξ3\n−ξ2ebtot−ξ1nS)nS, zmin = ξ−1\n3 e\n−ξ1\nξ2 , and zmax = ξ−1\n3 e\nbmax−ξ1\nξ2\n. The transformed problem\nfor the special case system, ˆPo\nSC, can be solved efﬁciently by using standard convex problem\nsolvers [15]. The details of the convex optimization-based approach can be found in our previous\nwork [10], [11].\nV. NUMERICAL RESULTS\nThe numerical results are obtained by considering a rectangular indoor environment of size\n25 m×25 m where an AP, which is located at the center of the ceiling of the indoor environment,\nserves 15 users. We consider the spectrum with a bandwidth of 50 GHz that exist in either (i)\nthe NACSR srn1 between 0.557 and 0.671 THz or (ii) the NACSR srn2 between 0.752 and\n0.868 THz is used to serve the users. We clarify that on one hand, the molecular absorption\ncoefﬁcient, k(f), in srn2 can be modeled as an exponential function of frequency with minimal\napproximation errors. Hence, the spectrum allocation problem in srn2 is a special case of the\n13\nTABLE I\nVALUE OF PARAMETERS USED IN SECTION V.\nParameter\nValue\nSystem Parameters\nDifference between the heights of AP and\n1.7 m\nusers\nAntenna gains, GA, GU\n30 dBi, 20 dBi\nNoise power density, N0\n−174 dBm/Hz\nPower budget, ptot\n-5 dBm\nUpper bound on power per sub-band, pmax\n5\n4\nptot\nnI\nUpper bound on sub-band bandwidth, bmax\n5 GHz\nHyper-Parameters of the Unsupervised Learning Model\nLearning rates, δΘ δλ\n0.05, 0.025\nNumber of iterations\n500\nTotal number of realization of d, nT\n300\nActivation function of 1st to 4th layer, σ(ℓ)(·) ReLU\nActivation function of the 5th layer, σ(ℓ)(·)\nϑ·sigmoid, ϑ∈{pmax,bmax}\nParameters used for the Convex Optimization-based Approach\nExponential model parameters in srn1, η\n101.83,-10-10.04,10-1.23\nExponential model parameters in srn2, η\n100.89,-10-10.8,-10-1.53\nTransformation model parameters, ξ\n109.7,1010.7,10−3\ngeneral spectrum allocation problem considered in this work.

The initial weights of the\nDNN are Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance, and the initial biases\nare set to 0. The initial values of λ are set to a small constant of 0.1. The values of other\nsystem parameters, hyper-parameters of the unsupervised learning model, and the parameters of\nthe convex optimization-based approach used for numerical results are summarized in Table I.\nIn Fig.4, we show the convergence of the proposed unsupervised learning-based approach when\nk(f) within the spectrum of interest can be modeled as an exponential function of frequency, i.e.,\nconsidering the special case system investigated in Section IV. To this end, we plot the aggregated\nmultiuser data rate, RAG = 1T\nnSr, the value of 1T\nnSp −ptot, and the value of 1T\nnSb −btot obtained\n14\n100\n200\n300\n400\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n(a)\n100\n200\n300\n400\n-0.15\n-0.1\n-0.05\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n(b)\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n(c)\nFig. 4. The aggregated multiuser data rate, RAG, and total power and bandwidth constraints satisfaction when k(f) within the\nspectrum of interest can be modeled as an exponential function of frequency, i.e., in the special case system investigated in\nSection IV.\nfrom the unsupervised learning-based approach in Figs. 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c), respectively, when\nthe spectrum allocation problem is implemented in srn2. Also, the value of RAG obtained from\nthe convex optimization-based approach is plotted in Fig.4(a). We ﬁrst observe from Fig.4(a) that\nfor several initial iterations, the value of RAG obtained using the unsupervised learning-based\napproach is higher than that obtained using the convex optimization-based approach. This is due\nto the occasional violation of the constraints (5b) and (5d) that occur at corresponding initial\niterations, which can be validated by observing 1T\nnSp−ptot and 1T\nnSb−btot in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c),\nrespectively. Moreover, after 200 iterations, we observe that the value of RAG obtained using\nthe unsupervised learning-based approach converges to the optimal value obtained using the\nconvex optimization-based approach, which shows the correctness of our proposed unsupervised\nlearning-based approach. Finally, we observe from Figs. 4(b) and 4(c) that after 200 iterations,\nthe values of 1T\nnSp−ptot and 1T\nnSb−btot of the proposed unsupervised learning-based approach are\nvery close to zero, which reﬂects that constraints (5b) and (5d) are satisﬁed when the proposed\n15\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n(a)\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n-0.15\n-0.1\n-0.05\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n(b)\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n(c)\nFig. 5. The aggregated multiuser data rate, RAG, and total power and bandwidth constraints satisfaction when k(f) within the\nspectrum of interest cannot be modeled as an exponential function of frequency, i.e., in the generalized system investigated in\nSections II and III.\nunsupervised learning-based approach is used.\nWe next show the convergence of the proposed unsupervised learning-based approach when\nk(f) within the spectrum of interest cannot be modeled as an exponential function of frequency,\ni.e., considering the generalized system investigated in Sections II and III. To this end, we plot\nRAG, 1T\nnSp −ptot, and 1T\nnSb −btot in Figs. 5(a), 5(b), and 6(c), respectively, when the spectrum\nallocation problem is implemented in srn1. We clarify that in srn1, k(f) cannot be modeled as an\nexponential function of frequency with minimal approximation errors. However, for the sake of\ncomparison, we obtain approximate solutions to the spectrum allocation problem in srn1 using\nthe convex optimization approach while utilizing an inaccurate approximation for k(f) in srn1,\nand plot the resulting RAG in Fig.5(a). Once again, we observe the overshoot in RAG, 1T\nnSp−ptot,\nand 1T\nnSb −btot for several initial iterations and the satisfaction of the constraints (5b) and (5d)\nafter 200 iterations in Figs. 5(a)-5(c), which are similar to Figs. 4(a)-4(c). Apart from them, we\nfurther observe that the value of RAG obtained using the unsupervised learning-based approach\n16\n3.5\n4\n4.5\n5\n5.5\n6\n6.5\n7\n7.5\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nFig. 6. Aggregated multiuser data rate, RAG, versus the upper bound on sub-band bandwidth, bmax, when spectrum allocation\nin srn1 and srn2.\nconverges to a value higher than that obtained using the convex optimization-based approach. This\nis because when the convex optimization-based approach is used, where an exponential function\nwith high approximation errors is used to model k(f), only the sub-optimal RAG is obtained.\nThis shows the signiﬁcance of our proposed unsupervised learning-based approach, i.e., it gives\nmuch higher RAG for the spectrum allocation problem when k(f) within the spectrum of interest\ncannot be modeled as an exponential function of frequency.\nFinally, we plot RAG achieved by the spectrum allocation strategy with ESB [6]–[9] and\nthe spectrum allocation strategy with ASB that is obtained from both convex optimization and\nunsupervised learning-based approaches, versus the upper bound on sub-band bandwidth, bmax,\nin Fig.6. We ﬁrst observe that the proposed spectrum strategy with ASB achieves a signiﬁcantly\nhigher RAG compared to the strategy with ESB for different bmax, which demonstrates the beneﬁts\nof our proposed strategy with ASB. Second, we observe that in srn1, the value of RAG obtained\nusing the unsupervised learning-based approach converges to values higher than that obtained\nusing the convex optimization-based approach for all bmax. This again shows the signiﬁcance of\nour proposed unsupervised learning-based approach to obtain higher RAG, especially when k(f)\nwithin the spectrum of interest cannot be modeled as an exponential function of frequency.\n17\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nWe investigated multi-band-based spectrum allocation with ASB for multiuser THzCom sys-\ntems. We ﬁrst formulated an optimization problem and then proposed an unsupervised learning-\nbased approach to obtaining near-optimal sub-band bandwidth and transmit power. In the pro-\nposed unsupervised learning-based approach, we ﬁrst employed an ofﬂine training phase to train\na DNN while utilizing a loss function inspired by the Lagrangian of the formulated problem.\nThen using the trained DNN, we approximated the near-optimal solutions to the optimization\nproblem for the given distance vector. Numerical results showed that when the values of the\nmolecular absorption coefﬁcient within the spectrum cannot be modeled as an exponential\nfunction of frequency, the data rate obtained by our proposed unsupervised learning-based\napproach outperforms that obtained by the existing convex optimization-based approach.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.
