INTRODUCTION\nDeep learning-based methods represent the current state-of-\nthe-art for solving pattern recognition tasks [1], [2]. In recent\nyears, advances in deep learning have led to remarkable perfor-\nmance improvements in numerous areas of pattern recognition\nincluding biometric recognition [3], [4]. These developments\nhave further facilitated the incorporation of biometric tech-\nnologies in personal, commercial, and governmental identity\nmanagement applications as evidenced by various market\nvalue studies [5], [6].\nIn the international standard ISO/IEC 2382-37 [7], the\nterm biometrics is deﬁned as: “automated recognition of\nindividuals based on their biological and behavioural charac-\nteristics”. There exist several highly distinctive biological and\nbehavioural characteristics which are suitable for recognising\nindividuals, examples of prominent physiological characteris-\ntics are shown in ﬁgure 1.\nIn an automated biometric system, a capture device (e.g.\na camera) is used to acquire a biometric sample (e.g. facial\nimage) during the enrolment process. Signal processing al-\ngorithms are subsequently applied to the biometric sample,\nFig. 1. Examples of physiological biometric characteristics. From left to right:\nface, ﬁngerprint, and iris of a single subject.\nwhich pre-process it (e.g. detection and normalisation of the\nface), estimate the quality of the acquired sample, and extract\ndiscriminative features from it. The resulting feature vector is\nﬁnally stored as reference template. At the time of authen-\ntication, another biometric sample is processed in the same\nway resulting in a probe template. Comparison and decision\nalgorithms enable ascertaining of similarity of a reference\nand a probe template by comparing the corresponding feature\nvectors and establish whether or not the two biometric samples\nbelong to the same source.\nFor a long period of time, biometric signal processing\nalgorithms employed handcrafted features (e.g. texture de-\nscriptors). Nowadays, the use of deep learning has become\nincreasingly popular. Deep learning-based biometric technolo-\ngies utilise massive training datasets to learn rich and compact\nrepresentations of biometric characteristics. Until now, deep\nlearning has been applied to the vast majority of biometric\ncharacteristics including, e.g. face [8], ﬁngerprint [9], iris [10],\nvein [11], online signatures [12], or gait [13]. For a review\nof deep learning techniques applied within biometrics, the\ninterested reader is referred to [4], [14], [15].\nThe success and ubiquitous use of biometric technologies\nhas raised different privacy concerns due to the potential\nmisuse of biometric data. In response to this issue, current\nprivacy regulations contain provisions on the storage and use\nof biometric data. For instance, the General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR) [16] generally classiﬁes biometric data\nas sensitive data which require protection. It is important\nto note that this applies to biometric samples as well as\nbiometric templates. While the latter might not be human-\ninterpretable, these can be misused to launch cross-matching\narXiv:2303.02715v1  [cs.CV]  5 Mar 2023\nattacks and approximations of biometric samples can be re-\nconstructed from unprotected biometric templates [17]. It is\nwell-known that traditional encryption methods are unsuitable\nfor protecting biometric data, due to the natural intra-class\nvariance of biometric characteristics. More precisely, biometric\nvariance prevents the usage of symmetric cryptography and\ntraditional hash functions with biometric input data since slight\nchanges in the unprotected domain automatically leads to\ndrastic changes in the protected domain. Consequently, the\nuse of conventional cryptographic methods does not enable\npermanent protection since it would require a decryption of\nprotected biometric data prior to the comparison.\nBiometric template protection [18], [19] refers to a class\nof technologies which are capable of permanently protecting\nbiometric reference data. In contrast to conventional biometric\nrecognition methods, biometric template protection schemes\ngenerate protected reference templates (while unprotected bio-\nmetric data is discarded). Protected templates prevent from\nreconstruction attacks, but nevertheless make it possible to\nperform a biometric comparison in the protected domain.\nMoreover, template protection scheme typically enable the\nincorporation of random parameters in the generation process\nof protected templates. Thereby, protected templates become\nvariable and can be changed which prevents from cross-\nmatching attacks. The operating principle of biometric tem-\nplate protection is detailed in section II.\nBiometric template protection has been an active ﬁeld of\nresearch for more than two decades. Figure 2 shows the annual\nnumber of scientiﬁc publications dealing with biometric tem-\nplate protection. Clearly, a non-declining interest in biometric\ntemplate protection is observable. It is reasonable to assume\nthat biometric template protection approaches introduced in\nthe last couple of years are incorporating deep learning-based\nmethods. In many cases, the feature extraction step is based on\ndeep learning techniques in order to achieve competitive bio-\nmetric performance which in turn enhances privacy protection\nas well as security (see section III). However, beyond the use\nof deep learning for feature extraction, there exist numerous\nfurther processing steps in biometric template protection that\ncan beneﬁt from deep learning techniques, e.g. feature type\ntransformation or feature alignment. This work is intended to\nprovide an overview of different approaches of incorporating\ndeep learning methods into various processing steps of bio-\nmetric template protection schemes with the overall goal of\nprivacy protection. In addition, deep learning-based attacks on\nbiometric template protection schemes are summarised. Note\nthat in contrast to other surveys in the ﬁeld, this work does\nnot intend to completely survey existing template protection\nschemes. In contrast, this work is meant to capture general\ntrends of broad interest in the application of deep learning\ntechniques in the ﬁeld of biometric template protection. It is\nmeant to be a milepost along the research area of biometric\ntemplate protection, offering guidance about future research\ndirections.\nThis work is organised as follows: fundamentals of bio-\nmetric template protection schemes are brieﬂy introduced in\nFig. 2.\nAnnual amount of scientiﬁc publications containing the terms\n“biometric template protection” or “biometric information protection”.1\n1https://app.dimensions.ai/ (encyclopaedia entries have not been counted)\nsection II. The impact of accuracy gains in deep learning-\nbased biometric systems on biometric template protection are\ndiscussed in section III. Section IV surveys the use of deep\nlearning techniques for the purpose of feature type transfor-\nmation. Deep learning-based methods which are employed to\nachieve privacy protection are summarised in section V. Sub-\nsequently, deep learning-based attacks on biometric template\nprotection schemes are discussed in section VI. Section VII\nlists further works which incorporate deep learning techniques\nthat are relevant for biometric template protection. Finally, a\nsummary is given in section VIII.\nII. BIOMETRIC TEMPLATE PROTECTION\nFor comprehensive surveys on pre-deep learning biometric\ntemplate protection the reader is referred to [18]–[21]. Biomet-\nric template protection schemes use auxiliary data to obtain\npseudonymous identiﬁers from unprotected biometric data.\nBiometric comparisons are then performed via pseudonymous\nidentiﬁers while unprotected biometric data are discarded.\nBiometric template protection methods are commonly cate-\ngorised as cancelable biometrics, biometric cryptosystems, and\nbiometrics in the encrypted domain. Cancelable biometrics\nemploy transforms in signal or feature domain which enable a\nbiometric comparison in the transformed (encrypted) domain\n[22], [23]. In contrast, the majority of biometric cryptosystems\nbinds a key to a biometric feature vector resulting in a\nprotected template. Biometric comparison is then performed\nindirectly by verifying the correctness of a retrieved key\n[24]. That is, biometric cryptosystems further allow for the\nderivation of digital keys from protected biometric templates,\ne.g. fuzzy commitment [25] and fuzzy vault scheme [26].\nAlternatively, homomorphic encryption has frequently been\nsuggested for biometric template protection [27], [28]. Homo-\nmorphic encryption makes it possible to compute operations\nin the encrypted domain which are functionally equivalent to\nthose in the plaintext domain and thus enables the estimation\nof certain distances between protected biometric templates.\nA general framework for biometric template protection\nmethods is deﬁned in ISO/IEC 24745 [29]. At enrolment,\nbiometric data M and some random secret k are fed to\nFeature\nextraction\nTemplate\nBiometric\nsample\nProtected\ntemplate\nPseudonymous\nidentifier\nencoder\nKey\n(a) feature level\nFeature\nextraction\nBiometric\nsample\nProtected\ntemplate\nPseudonymous\nidentifier\nencoder\nKey\nProtected\nsample\n(b) signal level\nFig. 3. Pseudonymous identiﬁer encoders applied at (a) feature level and (b) signal level.\na pseudonymous identiﬁer encoder (PIE). The randomness\nk can be a subject- or application-speciﬁc secret. PIE then\ngenerates a pseudonymous identiﬁer PI and auxiliary data\nAD, PIE(M, k) = [PI, AD]. That is, PI and AD constitute\nthe protected template. In detail, PI represents a protected\nidentity and AD is subject-speciﬁc auxiliary data which might\nas well be protected. AD is used to reproduce PI in the\nauthentication process. The unprotected biometric data M\nis discarded at the end of the enrolment procedure. At the\ntime of authentication, the pseudonymous identiﬁer recorder\n(PIR) takes biometric data M ∗and AD as input and calcu-\nlates another pseudonymous identiﬁer PI∗. This process may\nalso require a repeated presentation of k, e.g. in the case\nof cancelable biometrics. Subsequently, the pseudonymous\nidentiﬁer comparator (PIC) compares PI with the stored\nPI∗, PIC(PI, PI∗) = s. Depending on comparators, the\ncomparison result s is either a binary decision (yes/no) or\na similarity score which is then compared against a threshold\nin order to obtain a binary decision.\nNearly all biometric template protection schemes can be\ndescribed in the aforementioned framework. It is important to\nnote that the biometric data M can be of different represen-\ntations. While the majority of biometric template protection\nmethods are applied to biometric feature vectors (templates),\nsome are applied at signal level, e.g. in the image domain. The\ndifference in applying the PEI in feature and signal domain is\nillustrated in ﬁgure 3. In such schemes, a subsequent feature\nextraction process is necessary which can be seen as part of\nthe PIE.\nThe requirements on biometric template protection schemes\nare deﬁned in ISO/IEC IS 24745 [29]:\n• Unlinkability: the infeasibility of determining if two or\nmore protected templates were derived from the same\nbiometric instance, e.g. face. By fulﬁlling this property,\ncross-matching across different databases is prevented. It\ncan only be achieved by incorporating a random secret k\nin PIE.\n• Irreversibility: the infeasibility of reconstructing the\noriginal biometric data given a protected identity PI and\nits corresponding auxiliary data AD. In certain attack\nmodels, the secret k may additionally be available2. To\nachieve this goal the PIE needs to extract the protected\ntemplate in an irreversible manner using a one-way func-\ntion. With this property fulﬁlled, the privacy protection\nis enhanced, and additionally the security of the system\nis increased against reconstruction attacks.\n• Renewability: the possibility of revoking old protected\ntemplates and creating new ones from the same biometric\ninstance and/or sample, e.g. face image, without the\nsubject needing to re-enroll. With this property fulﬁlled,\nit is possible to revoke and reissue the templates in case\nthe database is compromised, thereby preventing misuse.\nAgain, this goal is achieved through the incorporation of\nrandom secrets into PIE.\n• Performance preservation: the requirement of the bio-\nmetric performance not being signiﬁcantly impaired by\nthe protection scheme.\nSome research efforts and standardisation activities have\nbeen devoted to establishing metrics for evaluating the\naforementioned properties of biometric template protection\nschemes, e.g. in [30]–[34]. Nonetheless, additional speciﬁc\ncryptanalytic methods may be necessary to precisely estimate\nthe security/privacy protection achieved by a particular tem-\nplate protection scheme. Different attack models for describing\nscenarios and assumptions of attacks on biometric template\nprotection schemes are standardised in ISO/IEC IS 30136 [34].\n2In a scenario, where k is known to the attacker, irreversibility can not be\nachieved by some template protection schemes, e.g. homomorphic encryption.\nThe most restrictive model is referred to as na¨ıve model in\nwhich an attacker has neither information of the biometric tem-\nplate protection scheme, nor owns a large biometric database.\nHowever, it is common practise to analysed template pro-\ntection schemes under Kerckhoffs‘s principle. In this general\nmodel, an adversary is assumed to possess full knowledge of\nthe template protection algorithm. In addition, the adversary\nmay have access to one or more protected templates from\none or more databases. In the most challenging full disclosure\nmodel, the general model is augmented by disclosing the\nsecrets (if any) to the attacker.\nIII. ACCURACY AND PRIVACY PROTECTION\nAs mentioned before, deep learning-based pattern recog-\nnition has the edge over previous handcrafted methods [35].\nObviously, the availability of sufﬁcient training data is a\nprerequisite deep learning-based approaches. In the ﬁeld of\nbiometric recognition, the use of deep learning techniques is\ncontinuously improving biometric performance, i.e. recogni-\ntion accuracy, for various biometric characteristics [4]. Per-\nformance gains have been achieved by incorporating deep\nlearning-based methods at various processing stages of biomet-\nric systems including detection, segmentation, quality control,\nor feature extraction. The latter processing step has received\nmost attention in the development of deep learning techniques.\nIt should be noted that said performance gains are usually more\npronounced when a large amount of training data is available\nand vice versa.\nThe performance of biometric algorithms is determined by\nvarious metrics standardised in ISO/IEC IS 19795-1 [36]. Most\nimportantly, the following metrics are reported to measure\nrecognition accuracy of a biometric veriﬁcation system:\n• False Non-Match Rate (FNMR): the FNMR is the\nproportion of completed mated comparison trials that\nresult in a comparison decision of “non-match”.\n• False Match Rate (FMR): the FMR is the proportion of\na speciﬁed set of completed non-mated comparison trials\nthat result in a comparison decision of “match”.\nIn template protection schemes, these performance metrics\nare also applicable. However, for some classes of schemes, e.g.\nbiometric cryptosystems, the conﬁguration of a desired opera-\ntion point may turn out to be more complex. While the FNMR\nis related to the usability of the biometric system, the FMR\nis a measure of security. Both rates depend on the decison\nthreshold of the biometric system. There is a relation between\nthe FMR and the security of a template protection scheme.\nThe so-called False Accept Security (FAS) is expressed in\nbits and corresponds to an encryption using a key of that bit-\nlength. The FAS provides a good approximation of the security\nof a template protection scheme because the false accept\nattack is typically one of the most efﬁcient attacks. In a false\naccept attack, the adversary iteratively simulates non-mated\nauthentication trails until a false match is reached. The FAS (in\nbits) is often estimated as FAS = −log2(FMR). For instance,\na biometric system operated at a FMR of 0.01% achieves a\nsecurity level of approximately 13 bits. However, it should\nbe noted that an attacker can deviate from the parameters\ncorresponding to the operational FMR. Additionally, the time\nrequired for performing a single authentication attempt should\nbe taken into account when estimating the FAS. Alternatively\nto the FAS, many published works report the Brute Force\nSecurity (BFS) as a measure of security. Usually, the BFS is\nderived from the size of an employed secret k (b= key space).\nHowever, the BFS often overestimates the effective security\nof a biometric template protection scheme.\nThe aforementioned FAS directly relates to the privacy\nprotection cappabilities of a biometric template protection\nscheme. Assume that an attacker requires at most FMR−1\nauthentication attempts to ﬁnd a biometric data M ′ which\nresults in a false match for a target protected template. This\nmeans, M ′ is sufﬁciently close to M that was used to generate\nan attacked protected template [PI, AD]. Starting from M ′,\nfor the majority of template protection schemes, it is then\npossible for the attacker to reconstruct the original biometric\ndata M. In case M is a binary feature vector, the attacker\ncould iteratively ﬂip bits of M ′ until a false non-match is\nreached resulting in ˆ\nM. Hence, the Hamming distance of ˆ\nM\nand M is exactly one bit above the threshold for reaching a\nfalse match. The attacker would then iteratively ﬂip bits of\nˆ\nM. If ﬂipping the i-th bit results in a false match, the bit at\nthe i-th position of ˆ\nM is equal to the ﬂipped bit. If not, the\nbit at the i-th position of ˆ\nM has already been correct. Similar\nattacks can be applied for non-binary data representations.\nMany template protection concepts, in particular biometric\ncryptosystems, have been investigated several years ago, c.f.\nﬁgure 2. Hence, such earlier approaches have been applied\nto biometric systems utilising handcrafted feature extractors.\nCompared to such handcrafted approaches, deep learning-\nbased methods have been shown to improve biometric per-\nformance for systems based on different biometric charac-\nteristics [4]. This means that deep learning-based biometric\nsystems can be potentially operated at lower FMRs and,\nthus, provide a higher level of security. The same applies to\nbiometric template protection schemes utilising deep learning-\nbased techniques. For instance, recently proposed biometric\ncryptosystems utilizing deep learning-based face recognition\ncan be operated at FMRs signiﬁcantly below 0.1%, e.g. in [37],\n[38], while comparable older approaches based on handcrafted\nfeature extractors report unpractical FMRs above 10%, e.g.\nin [39]. While many biometric performance benchmarks have\nbeen published for various biometric characteristics, a com-\nprehensive empirical comparison between earlier handcrafted\nmethods and current deep learning-based methods is still\nmissing.\nThrough reduced error rates the level of privacy protection is\nsigniﬁcantly increased in such systems. However, some studies\nhave also reported an increased vulnerability of deep-learning-\nbased biometric systems to certain attacks subjected to their\nenhanced generalisation capabilities, e.g. in [40], [41].\nIV. FEATURE TYPE TRANSFORMATIONS\nBiometric feature vectors, i.e. templates, can be of different\nrepresentations depending on the type of feature elements\n(real, integer, or binary), their dimension and if they are ﬁxed-\nlength or variable-length. Common feature representations\nhave been established for templates of different biometric char-\nacteristics, e.g. minutiae sets for ﬁngerprints or binary codes\nfor iris. However, biometric template protection schemes, in\nparticular biometric cryptosystems, may require templates in\na distinct type of feature representation, e.g. ﬁxed-length\nbinary strings for the fuzzy commitment scheme [25]. To\nmake biometric templates compatible to a template protection\nscheme, so-called feature type transformation processes may\nbe required [42].\nDeep learning-based biometric feature extraction methods\nare commonly trained using differentiable loss functions, e.g.\nEuclidean distance. Therefore, extracted templates are usually\nrepresented as real-valued vector v of ﬁxed dimension n,\nv ∈Rn. Compared to variable sized feature vectors, this\nis favourable since it is expected to yield an equal level\nof security across subjects. It is important to note that the\nextraction of ﬁxed-length vectors is also possible for biometric\ncharacteristics where templates are usually not of variable size,\ne.g. ﬁngerprints. In [43], it was shown that deep networks can\nlearn to extract ﬁxed-length ﬁngerprint representations incor-\nporating domain knowledge, such as alignment and keypoint\n(minutiae) detection3.\nFixed-length real-valued vectors can be mapped to other\nrepresentations using common procedures [42]. Based on\nstatistical information about feature distributions, the feature\nspace of each feature element can be divided in (equally\nprobable) integer-labelled intervals. Subsequently, a quanti-\nsation can be performed by mapping each feature element\nto the integer value representing its interval. This results\nin a quantised feature vector q of same length, q ∈Nn\n0.\nTo obtain a binary feature vector b, each feature element\nof q is mapped to a binary string of length m. Different\nbinary encoding methods have been suggested in the scientiﬁc\nliterature [42]. The resulting binary vector consists consist of\nnm bits, b ∈{0, 1}nm. These feature type transformation\nsteps, which are illustrated in ﬁgure 4, may result in a loss of\nbiometric performance due to information loss cause by coarse\nquantisation. However, if parameters are chosen appropriately\nbiometric performance may be maintained, e.g. in [45]. A\nbinary vector b of length nm can be transformed back to an\ninteger vector q of length n by mapping consecutive chunks\nof m bits to their decimal representation. Further, b can be\ntransformed to an integer set s of variable length. For instance,\nthis feature set can consist of all indexes of 1s in the binary\nvector, s = {i|bi = 1} with bi ∈b. This feature type\ntransformation has been successfully applied to feature vectors\nobtained by deep learning-based feature extractors, e.g. in [37].\n3Note that a ﬁxed-length ﬁngerprint representation is different from ﬁxed-\nlength minutiae (vicinity) representations, e.g. in [44], which usually result in\na variable length ﬁngerprint representation.\nDCNN-based feature\nextraction\nBiometric\nsample\nQuantisation\nfloat vector (0.5, -0.8, . . . , 0.7)\ninteger vector (2, 0, . . . , 3)\nBinary encoding\nbinary vector (10, 00, . . . , 11)\nFig. 4. Feature type transformation: creating integer and binary vectors from\nﬂoat vectors extracted by deep neural networks.\nCompact, e.g. binary, representations (which additionally\nturn out to be beneﬁcial for workload reduction in biometric\nidentiﬁcation systems [46]) can also be extracted by deep\nlearning techniques. The term deep hashing has been coined as\nan umbrella term for methods which aim at extracting compact\nand stable representations with deep learning techniques [47].\nIf applied to biometric data, such methods would need to\novercome intra-class variations. Consequently, a reliable ex-\ntraction of stable feature vectors (deep hashes) would enable\na subsequent application of conventional (and provable secure)\ncryptographic algorithms for the purpose of template protec-\ntion. In the recent past, deep hashes have been extracted from\ndifferent biometric characteristics in various ways, e.g. in [48]–\n[51], including multi-biometrics [51]. Most of the proposed\nschemes, however, are focusing on facial images and have\nbeen recently surveyed in [52].\nIt is well-known that a single biometric characteristic, e.g.\na single ﬁngerprint or face, contains an insuffcient amount of\neffective entropy to resist attacks exploiting the feature dis-\ntribution, speciﬁcally false accept attacks. Therefore, several\nresearchers have proposed multi-biometric template protection\nsystems [53], e.g. in [54], [55]. In multi-biometric template\nprotection systems, the fusion process should be performed\nat the feature level to achieve high security levels [56].\nIn contrast, separate storage of multiple protected biometric\nBiometric\nsample\nProtected\ntemplate\nPseudonymous\nidentifier\nencoder\nKey\nFig. 5. Application of deep neural network for biometric template protection.\ntemplates would enable parallelized attacks [57] (analogous to\nthe use of multiple short passwords compared to one long pass-\nword). In multi-biometric template protection schemes, feature\ntype transformation methods become increasingly important.\nTo conduct a feature level fusion, it is vital that features of\nmultiple biometric sources are of the same representation. As\nmentioned before, this is generally feasible for the application\nof deep learning-based feature extraction methods.\nNote that in case a fusion of different biometric characteris-\ntics is performed, it is likely that corresponding templates are\nof different size. This means, in a concatenation of templates\n(of the same representation) an implicit weighting is intro-\nduced according to the template sizes, i.e. larger templates are\nstronger weighted and vice versa. Such imbalance can in turn\nhave a negative impact on the overall security of a biometric\ntemplate protection system, since an attacker could merely\nfocus on launching a false accept attack on the biometric\ncharacteristic which constitutes the largest relative part of the\nfused template. Further, it is important to note that templates\nextracted from different biometric characteristics may exhibit\nvarying biometric variances (intra- and inter-class).\nV. TEMPLATE PROTECTION WITH DEEP NETWORKS\nVery recently, ﬁrst attempts have been made to directly\nincorporate biometric template protection into deep learning-\nbased feature extraction. The key idea behind these approaches\nis to embed some randomness into neural network-based\nfeature extraction methods. That is, the neural network itself\nserves as PIE taking a biometric sample M and a random key\nk as input, see ﬁgure 5. This can be achieved by introducing\na key-based random activation of neurons, i.e. a random sub-\nnetwork selection, or random permutation, e.g. in [58]. Such\na network can be applied subsequently to an existing network\ntrained for biometric recognition. Alternatively, networks can\nbe trained from scratch or a pre-trained model can be adapted\nto achieve template protection properties [59]. Moreover, re-\nsearchers have suggested special loss functions, e.g. in [59],\n[60], that may even incorporate a comparison of keys as\nsuggested in [59].\nThe aforementioned concepts have mostly been applied to\nfacial data [52]. However, similar schemes have already been\nproposed for other biometric characteristics as well as multi-\nbiometric systems, e.g. in [61], [62]. While the reported results\nof these very recently proposed methods are promising, a\nrigorous analysis of potential vulnerabilities is needed.\nSo-called privacy-enhancing biometrics have been recently\nproposed by various research groups. These methods do not di-\nrectly fall under the category of biometric template protection.\nIn contrast to traditional template protection schemes, these\nmethods attempt to only remove (or conceal) soft-biometric\ninformation, e.g. gender or age, from biometric data (while\nleaving other useful information unchanged). In other words,\nthese approaches could be seen as attempting to fulﬁll the\nrequirement of irreversibility for soft biometric attributes while\nunlinkability or renewability are not intended properties [63].\nConsequently, privacy-enhancing biometrics do not require the\nincorporation of a random secret. Like cancelable biometric\ntransformations, privacy-enhancing functions can be applied at\neither image level, representation level, or at inference level. At\nimage level deep learning-based techniques, e.g. convolutional\nautoencoder, can be applied to perturb images with the goal of\nconcealing soft-biometric information [64]. At representation\nlevel it is possible to (re-)train a biometric recognition system\nwhile incorporating soft-biometric classiﬁers in the used loss\nfunction. Thereby, the utility of the extracted features should\nbe maximised while at the same time soft-biometric informa-\ntion should be minimised.\nThe majority of works on soft-biometric privacy enhance-\nment focuses on face recognition [65], while the underly-\ning concepts have been shown to be applicable to other\nbiometric characteristics from which it is possible to derive\nsoft-biometric information, e.g. gait [66]. Many works have\nreported impressive results, e.g. in [67], [68], while the pri-\nvacy protection capabilities of proposed methods are usually\ntested using simple machine learning-based classiﬁers and\nvisualisations of dimensionality reduction tools. It has been\nargued that a more rigorous analysis is necessary to measure\nthe actual privacy enhancement provided by such techniques\n[69]. Moreover, it has already been shown that different soft-\nbiometric privacy enhancement methods can be detectable [70]\nand vulnerable to elaborated attacks [71].\nVI. DEEP LEARNING-BASED ATTACKS\nBiometric systems are challenged by numerous potential\nattack vectors, see [72]. Some of the common attacks, e.g.\npresentation attacks, require knowledge about the original\nbiometric data M of the target subject to be attacked. In\nbiometric template protection schemes, M is replaced by a\nprotected biometric reference [PI, AD] such that said attacks\nbecome less relevant. However, it was recently shown that\ndeep learning techniques can be applied to create artiﬁcial\nbiometric samples for which the probability of achieving a\nfalse match when being compared against unknown biomet-\nric references is signiﬁcantly higher than that of a random\nimpostor. Inspired by the concept of master keys, different\nresearchers proposed to train a Generative Adversarial Net-\nwork (GAN) to create such biometric samples. These samples\ncan then be applied to launch dictionary attacks on biometric\nveriﬁcation systems that allow multiple authentication attempts\non biometric identiﬁcation systems. The effectiveness of such\nattacks has been demonstrated for ﬁngerprints [73] and face\nimages [74]. Theoretically, such attacks can be applied to\ntemplate protection systems, too.\nAs mentioned earlier, a false match with [PI, AD] usu-\nally makes it possible for an attacker to reconstruct a close\napproximation of M. In most cases, M is a feature vector\nof a certain type, e.g. binary. This means, an attacker may\nadditionally want to reconstruct the corresponding biometric\nsample, e.g. ﬁngerprint or face image. Such a sample could\nthen be misused by the attacker to launch further attacks in\nparticular presentation attacks [75].\nDevelopments in deep learning have shown impressive\nresults for reconstructing biometric samples from their corre-\nsponding feature vectors. Particularly deconvolutional neural\nnetworks can be employed to reconstruct biometric samples\nfrom their corresponding embeddings in the latent space, e.g.\nfor face in [76]. Further, deep learning-based methods can be\nemployed to reconstruct biometric samples from conventional\nfeature representations, e.g. minutiae sets in [77]. For different\nbiometric characteristics, it has been shown that this is even\npossible for binarised feature vectors. For instance, speciﬁc\ndeep learning-based methods have been proposed to recon-\nstruct face and vein images from binary feature vectors in [78]\nand [79], respectively. This poses a severe security risk which\nnecessitates strong protection of biometric reference data to\nprevent from misuse, e.g. identity fraud. In biometric template\nprotection schemes, said reconstruction attacks become a seri-\nous threat, especially in a full disclosure attack model. In this\nattack model, the attacker is in possession of the secret k such\nthat the original biometric data M can likely be reconstructed\n[80]. Directly reconstructing biometric samples from protected\ntemplates with such approaches may be infeasible. However,\nreconstruction methods can be applied after launching a false\naccept attack [78].\nThe aforementioned attacks can be applied as part of an\nattack on biometric template protection. However, so far no\ndeep learning-based methods that directly attack template pro-\ntection schemes have been published in the scientiﬁc literature.\nNevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that such attacks may\nsoon be proposed.\nFinally, it is worth noting that the improved generalisation\ncapabilities of deep learning-based biometric systems can\nlead to robustness against certain perturbations which have\nbeen introduced for the purpose of template protection. Such\nperturbations have frequently been proposed for cancelable\nbiometrics [22]. For instance, it has been shown in [81] that\ncurrent deep learning-based face recognition systems are to a\ncertain degree robust against the application of image warping\nwhich has previously been suggested to obscure and, hence,\nprotect facial data [72].\nVII. FURTHER WORKS\nSome works in the area of deep learning are focusing\non further processing steps that are vital in biometric tem-\nplate protection schemes. One example is pre-alignment of\nbiometric data. Since template protection schemes protect\nand, therefore, conceal the original biometric data it is often\nimpossible to perform an alignment during comparison. This\nis particularly the case for biometric cryptosystems. Alignment\nprocesses at comparison stage are for instance commonly\nrequired for pairwise comparisons of ﬁngerprints [82] or irides\n[83]. Since the original biometric data is “unseen” during the\ncomparison of protected templates, pre-alignment methods are\nnecessary.\nIn [84], [85], different deep learning techniques have been\ninvestigated for the purpose of ﬁngerprint alignment. In par-\nticular, a ﬁngerprint pre-alignment method which can be\nemployed as pre-processing step in ﬁngerprint-based template\nprotection systems was proposed in [85]. Similar approaches\ncould be applied to other biometric characteristics.\nAs mentioned in the beginning, homomorphic encryption\ncan be used to permanently protect biometric data. Homomor-\nphic encryption makes it possible to compute basic operations\nin the encrypted domain which are functionally equivalent to\nthose in the plaintext domain and thus enables the estimation\nof certain distances between protected biometric templates.\nIn addition, it has been shown that deep Learning-based\nclassiﬁcation tasks can be performed on homomorphically\nencrypted data [86]. These so-called CryptoNets could also\nbe applied to perform neural network-based classiﬁcations on\nhomomorphically encrypted biometric data, e.g. prediction of\nsoft-biometric attributes. Motivated by that fact that homomor-\nphic encryption does not achieve irreversibility when the secret\nk is known to an attacker, researchers have recently proposed\nto apply homomorphic encryption on top of cancelable bio-\nmetrics [87], [88]. Thereby, some protection is retained, even\nin the full disclosure attack model.\nVIII. SUMMARY\nThe interest in biometric technologies has been steadily\ngrowing in recent years. Systems incorporating biometric\ntechnologies have become ubiquitous in personal, commercial,\nand governmental identity management applications. Deep\nneural networks currently represent the most popular method\nfor pattern recognition and are applied in various biometric\nsystems.\nIn response to privacy concerns raised against the (mis-)use\nof biometric data, template protection schemes that embody\nfundamental data protection principles have been introduced.\nThis work provides an overview of how recent developments\nin deep learning affect biometric template protection. Several\nresearch directions are discussed in which deep learning-\nbased techniques can be employed to improve template pro-\ntection systems. In addition, deep learning-based attacks are\ndescribed. By focusing on recent trends of deep learning in the\nresearch ﬁeld of template protection, this survey is intended\nto complement existing works that review template protection\nmethods published in the scientiﬁc literature.\nACKNOLEDGEMENTS\nThis research work has been funded by the German Federal\nMinistry of Education and Research and the Hessian Ministry\nof Higher Education, Research, Science and the Arts within\ntheir joint support of the National Research Center for Applied\nCybersecurity ATHENE.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Y.
