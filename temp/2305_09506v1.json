INTRODUCTION\nProcesses constitute a useful way of representing and struc-\nturing the activities and resources involved in organization\nInformation Systems (IS) from almost any domain. Daily,\nmore event data is being produced and recorded, making\nit necessary to provide organizations with tools capable of\nprocessing such vast amounts of data and extracting the\nvaluable knowledge hidden in it.\nProcess data is recorded as event logs, but its behavior is\nusually represented as process models (in a variety of notations\n[1]) that represent in a graphical manner the activities that take\nplace in a process as well as the dependencies between them.\nOther relevant properties of the process tend to be included\nin the model such as temporal properties, process execution-\nrelated statistics, etc. Apart from process models, information\nabout these properties is conveyed to users through visual an-\nalytics, as they are commonly used when providing advanced\nanalytics [1]. However, in real life scenarios process models\nare very complex, with a high number of relations between\nactivities. Furthermore, the amount of information that can\nbe added to enhance the process model is very high, and\nthe visual analytics related to said process information are\nquite difﬁcult to be understood and related to the underlying\nprocess for users, as deep knowledge of process modeling and\nanalytics is required.\nThis research was funded by the Spanish Ministry for Science, Innovation\nand Universities, the Galician Ministry of Education, University and Profes-\nsional Training and the ERDF/FEDER program (grants TIN2017-84796-C2-\n1-R, ED431C2018/29 and ED431G2019/04).\nIn the Natural Language Generation (NLG) [2] and Linguis-\ntic Descriptions of Data (LDD) [3] ﬁelds, different methods\nfor generating insights on data through natural language have\nbeen under development. Through different techniques, they\naim to provide users with natural language texts that capture or\nsummarize the most characteristic aspects of some data. This\ninformation can be easily consumed by users, as i) natural\nlanguage is the inherent way of communicating for humans,\ntherefore it does not rely on their capabilities to identify or\nunderstand patterns, trends, etc. from visual representations;\nand ii) it may include uncertain terms or expressions, which\nare very effective for communication. In this sense, research\nsuggests that in some domains knowledge and expertise are\nrequired to understand graphical information [4] and proves\nthat domain experts can take better decisions based on textual\ndescriptions than on graphical displays [5]. Therefore, natural\nlanguage descriptions seem a good approach to enable or\nenhance the understanding of processes and its analytics as\nthey can summarize, combine and communicate information\nin ways it would not be possible with visual representations.\nIn this paper, we investigate a real-life use case of a process\nin the health-care domain which could potentially beneﬁt from\nnatural language descriptions in order to achieve a better\nunderstanding of what is really happening in it.\nWe propose a series of fuzzy temporal protoforms (fuzzy\nlinguistic descriptions of data) in the framework of the\nautomatic generation of quantitative and qualitative natural\nlanguage descriptions of processes. With a general model that\nincludes temporal and causal information from processes and\nits attributes we are able to recall causal relations and temporal\ndistances between events, among other features. The use of\nfuzzy linguistic descriptions of data allows for modeling and\nmanaging the inherent imprecision of linguistic terms, which\nis very useful when summarizing temporal and other data. By\nintroducing imprecision in descriptions related to frequency\nand temporal characteristics of processes the expressiveness of\nthe approximation is enhanced. As fuzzy linguistic variables\nrepresent a language abstraction that compacts information\nand relations about sets of data, fuzzy quantiﬁed statements\nprovide a more human-friendly interface than process models\nor visualization techniques. This approach also introduces\nthe description of causal and temporal relationships between\nactivities of a process, including both frequency and temporal\narXiv:2305.09506v1  [cs.CL]  16 May 2023\ncharacteristics.\nSection II gives a deeper background in NLG, LDD and its\napplications on process data and event logs. It also contains\nbasic concepts of fuzzy quantiﬁed statements and process\nmining used in the proposed solution. Section III introduces\nthe proposed protoforms and an overview of the generation\nprocess. Section IV presents an evaluation of the proposal and\nsome concluding remarks.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK\nThe generation of natural language texts from data is a task\nwhich originated within the NLG ﬁeld [2]. Particularly, the\ngeneration of natural language descriptions over data has been\ntraditionally a task tackled by the Data-to-Text (D2T) research\ncommunity [6]. Parallel to NLG and D2T systems, in the\nfuzzy logic realm, the paradigms of Computing with Words\nand Linguistic Descriptions (or summaries) of Data (LDD)\nemerge for modelling and managing uncertainty in natural\nlanguage with the use of fuzzy sets [7]. These paradigms use\nthe concepts of linguistic descriptions of data and protoform\n[8], which aim on providing summaries involving linguistic\nterms with some degree of uncertainty or ambiguity present\non them.\nA. Linguistic Descriptions of Data\nLinguistic summaries or descriptions of data have been\ninvestigated by many researchers and applied in multiple\ndomains. Classically, fuzzy quantiﬁed sentences of type-I and\ntype-II have been the most used ones in the literature since\ntheir inception in early 1980’s [7]. From generating weather\nforecasts [9] or data-base summarization [10] to temporal\nseries summarization [11]. However, they have been only\ninvestigated succinctly on process data [12], [13].\nLinguistic descriptions of data are understood as sets of\ninstanced fuzzy quantiﬁed statements that are computed ac-\ncording to a dataset and a knowledge base for a given ap-\nplication domain for summarizing knowledge about variables\nand their values [14]. Fuzzy quantiﬁed statements follow\npredeﬁned formal structures or templates, that are referred to\nas protoforms which are composed mainly of four aspects:\n• A referential X is a set of objects for which certain\nproperty or set of properties holds (e.g. the set of cases\nfrom an event log).\n• A summarizer A used to indicate some property or\naggregation of properties (e.g. \"long waiting time\" or\n\"long waiting time and high number of medical tests\")\nof the object or referential of interest.\n• A (fuzzy) quantiﬁer Q (e.g. \"several\") used to express the\nquantity or proportion of data from the referential which\nfulﬁlls the properties indicated by the summarizer.\n• The degree of truth T used to relate the validity of\nthe protoform. Instancing a protoform involves assigning\nvalues to its elements (referential, quantiﬁer and summa-\nrizer) and computing its truth degree. The truth degree\ncan be calculated using any valid quantiﬁcation model\n[15], [16].\nCombining these elements, a sentence like \"In several cases\nthere was a long waiting time between the Medical Surgical\n(MS) session of a patient and its surgery\" can be created from\ntype-I protoform:\nQ X′s are A\n(1)\nIn some cases, one may want a ﬁner-grained description. A\nqualiﬁer can be added to the description to better deﬁne the\nscope of the sentence, giving place to type-II protoforms.\n• A qualiﬁer B, can make reference to any property or\naggregation of properties of the referential. It deﬁnes a\nsubset of it which fulﬁlls a property to a certain degree\nand will be evaluated against summarizer and quantiﬁer.\nSentences like \"In most cases where patients were males, there\nwas a long waiting time between the MS session of a patient\nand its surgery\" can be created from a type-II protoform:\nQ BX′s are A\n(2)\nBoth summarizer, qualiﬁer and quantiﬁer take the form of a\nlinguistic variable. Linguistic variables model the partitioning\nof the domain of a numeric or categorical variable into\nseveral properties (e.g., waiting time = {really short, short,\nas expected, long, extremely long}), where each property is\nknown as a linguistic value and is associated to a membership\nfunction that measures the degree in which different values\nof the original variable fulﬁll that property. These member-\nship functions are usually represented as trapezoid functions\nT[a, b, c, d]. This way, the degree to which a value fulﬁlls a\nproperty can be computed with its membership function as\nfollows:\nµT [a,b,c,d](x) =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0,\n(x ≤a) or (x > d)\nx−a\nb−a\na < x ≤b\n1,\nb < x ≤c\nd−x\nd−c\nc < x ≤d\n(3)\nSome limitations exist when using linguistic summaries of\ndata. In the literature mostly type-I and type-II protoforms\nare used without diving in a deeper natural language realiza-\ntion, however, presenting the user with a linguistic summary\ncomposed of multiple isolated type-I and type-II descriptions\nis not the most appropriate solution due to their lack of\nexpressiveness and limited semantics [14], [19]. One direction\nwhich has been followed recently in order to improve this\nlimited semantics is their extension with additional elements;\nas the temporal dimension (due to great availability of time\nseries data) or other domain speciﬁc information. Table I\nincludes some of the type-I and type-II protoforms that have\nbeen proposed in the literature on recent times that may be of\ninspiration in our case. On [14], [19] a more extensive review\nof protoforms and applications can be found.\nB. Process Mining\nProcess execution is recorded in event logs. Process mining\ngoal is to exploit that recorded event data, by automatically\ndiscovering the underlying process model, to extract with it\nvaluable, process related information in a meaningful way.\nTable I\nSEVERAL TYPES OF FUZZY PROTOFORMS DESCRIBED IN THE LDD LITERATURE\nAuthors\nYear\nProtoform\nVerbalized example\nCariñena [17]\n1999\nX was A in T\nTemperature was high in the last minutes\nIn T, X was A\nShortly after the increase in pressure, temperature was high\nCastillo-Ortega et al. [11]\n2001\nQ of D are A\nMost days of the cold season patient inﬂow was high\nAlmeida et al. [18]\n2013\nQ Y’s are P Qt times\nMost patients have high blood pressure most of the time.\nQ Y’s with C are P\nMost patients with disease X have low blood pressure.\nWilbik and Dijkman [12], [13]\n2015, 2017\nIn Q cases there was P\nIn most cases there was a short throughput time\nIn Q cases, when condition R was\nfulﬁlled there was P\nIn most cases when \"Registration\" was short, there was a\nshort throughput time.\nThis information can be used to understand what is really\nhappening in a process by providing insights which help to\nanticipate problems and streamline and improve processes\n[1]. Process mining serves as a bridge between classical\nbusiness process model analysis and data mining or data\nscience techniques. On the one hand, classical process model\nanalysis is a model-centric discipline; it puts all its emphasis\non theoretic process models without giving much attention to\nthe real execution data. However, the value of a process model\nis limited if too little attention is paid to the alignment between\nthe model and reality (recorded event data). On the other hand,\ndata mining techniques focus completely on the data without\npaying any attention to the model (or end-to-end processes).\nThese techniques are able to recall frequencies of events,\nnumber of events per case, and basic case statistics, but can not\nbe used to analyze bottlenecks, expected behaviors, deviation,\netc. so are not able to answer the most frequent questions\nwhen dealing with processes. Current linguistic summarization\ntechniques for process data [12], [13] focus solely on data\nmining techniques (they only use event log data) without\npaying attention to the underlying process model. This makes\nevident the need to propose a new series of protoforms which\ndo take in count both aspects of a process and are based on\nprocess-mining techniques.\nIn order to better describe the protoforms presented in this\npaper it is necessary to introduce some of the basic elements\nin a process and in an event log.\nAn activity α ∈A, being A the set of all activities, is each\nwell-deﬁned step in a process. Events e represent the execution\nof an activity α in a particular instant. They are characterized\nby two mandatory attributes: the executed activity α and the\ntimestamp of the event; but they can have additional attributes\nsuch as its associated resources, their time duration, etc.\nA trace is an ordered list of events where each event occurs\nat a certain instant relative to the other events in it i.e. it\nrepresents the sequence of events a case follows. A case c ∈C,\nbeing C the set of all cases in the process, then represents\na particular execution of the process and, as events, cases\nhave attributes. The most mandatory attributes of a case are\nits corresponding trace and its identiﬁer. Other attributes may\nbe its throughput time, the customer involved in the case, the\ncountry of an order, etc. Table II shows an example of an event\nlog, a multiset of cases L = [ˆc1, ..., ˆcn].\nBy applying discovery algorithms [1] the model of a process\ncan be extracted from an event log without any additional a-\nTable II\nEVENT LOG EXAMPLE.\ncase_id\nevent_activity\ncase_sex\nevent_time\n20629\nconsultation\nMale\n2013-06-04 09:00\n20629\nspecial-consultation\nMale\n2012-06-14 09:00\n20634\nechocardiogram\nFemale\n2012-06-21 09:00\n20634\nconsultation\nFemale\n2012-06-21 10:00\n21657\nechocardiogram\nMale\n2012-10-25 09:00\n21657\nconsultation\nMale\n2012-10-25 10:00\npriori information. The discovered model shows which activi-\nties take place (as nodes), its ordering and relations by describ-\ning causal dependencies between them (as arcs connecting the\nnodes). Figure 1 shows a simpliﬁed process model (only the\ntop 0.03% most common behavior is represented) of the use\ncase here presented.\nEstablishing a relation between a process model and the\nevent log the process model is extracted from is a key element\nin process mining. This can be done by replaying [1] an event\nlog over its corresponding process model, and allows to exploit\nthe four perspectives of process mining: organizational (infor-\nmation about resources), control-ﬂow (ordering of activities),\ncase (attributes of the cases) and time (timing and frequency\nof events) perspectives. In this proposal we will focus mainly\non the control-ﬂow, case and time perspectives, since these are\nthe perspectives where most questions are posed by experts in\ndomains such as healthcare [21]. Putting special emphasis on\nthe time perspective and providing ways to relate the three\nperspectives through new proposed protoforms.\nIII. PROPOSAL\nIn this section we propose a new series of protoforms\nfor processes, using as a guide a case study in the health-\ncare medical domain: the process related to the patients’\nmanagement in the Valvulopathy Unit of the Cardiology\nDepartment of the University Hospital of Santiago de Com-\npostela. In this Unit, consultations and medical examinations,\nsuch as echocardiograms or Computed Tomography scans are\nperformed to patients with aortic stenosis [22] in order to\ndecide their treatment (including surgery). Other information\nlike unexpected events (e.g. non-programmed admissions) and\npatient management activities (e.g. inclusion in the process)\nare also recorded in the event log.\nMedical experts show real interest in applying process\nmining techniques to this process, since it allows to extract\nFigure 1. Simpliﬁed model of the valvulopathy process represented with the InVerbis Analytics visualization tool [20].\nvaluable knowledge like, relationships between patients at-\ntributes (case attributes), relationships and delays between\ncrucial activities (timing and frequency of events) or dif-\nferent paths of the process patients with different attributes\nfollow (control-ﬂow perspective). However, understanding this\ninformation is highly difﬁcult for non process-expert users,\nthus why medical experts show interest in natural language\ndescriptions of health-care medical process. The protoforms\npresented in this paper are derived from experts needs in order\nto fulﬁll their information requirements.\nA. Temporal contextualization of attributes\nThis ﬁrst protoform aims at describing how attributes of\npatients behave during different stages of the process e.g.\n\"In year 2020, most patients had emergency admittance\". The\nextended protoform, also allows to see if any type of relation\nbetween attributes holds e.g. \"In year 2020, most patients\nwho underwent a surgery where older than 80\". We extend\nprotoforms (1) and (2) to the following ones, respectively:\nIn Ti, Q patients had attribute P\n(4)\nIn Ti, Q patients with attribute C had attribute P (5)\nWhere Q is a quantiﬁer, Ti is a time interval and C and\nP make reference to any of the attributes of a case that are\npresent on the event log, or any additional attributes computed\nwith expert knowledge after the process model is discovered.\nThis process of computing new attributes can be seen as the\nFeature Engineering task of Machine Learning. Process mining\ntechniques allow us to compute new attributes that domain\nexperts show high interest on such as the waiting time between\ntwo particular activities, the number of times one activity\ntriggers the execution of one another, etc.\nAttributes will be represented as linguistic variables to\nwhich the elements of the referential (patients or cases) will be\nevaluated against as in (3). In cases where the summarizer or\nqualiﬁer are categorical, as well as for property Ti (deﬁned by\nits start and end dates) we propose the use of crisp linguistic\nvalues. The membership of a value to these properties can\nbe computed straightforward by taking a = b and c = d in\nexpression (3).\nTruth value of (4) is computed directly following [17],\nfurthermore, we propose an extension of it to calculate the\ntruth value of (5) as:\nT = µQ\n\u0012Pn\ni=1 µT i(pi) ∧µP (pi) ∧µC(pi)\nPn\ni=1 µT (pi) ∧µC(pi)\n\u0013\n(6)\nwhere n is the number of patients (cases), p represents a\npatient (case), ∧represents the t-norm minimum which is used\nas conjunction. In (5) Zadeh’s quantiﬁcation model is used,\nalthough any valid quantiﬁcation model [15], [16] could be\nconsidered.\nB. Causality and temporal relationship between events\nThe time perspective is highly relevant in health-care med-\nical processes, as wait times between activities can have\na heavy impact on whether the treatment of a patient is\nsuccessful or not. Descriptions as \"In year 2020, in most\ncases, patient evaluation takes place shortly after its inclusion\"\nor in an extended form \"In year 2020, in most cases where\npatients had emergency admittance, patient intervention takes\nplace shortly after its MS session\" can be generated thanks to\nthe causal relationships between events that process mining is\nable to extract. Each event is characterized by its relationships\nwith \"input\" and \"output\" events (i.e. events that happen\nconsecutively before and consecutively after it) and the waiting\ntime between their execution. These relationships are the ones\ndescribed by the arcs in a process model [1]. Thus, a set of\nrelationships and wait times between all activities in a process\ncan be computed, allowing for the generation of the following\nproposed protoforms:\nIn Ti, in Q cases R\n(7)\nIn Ti, in Q cases where patient had attribute C R (8)\nWhere Ti, Q and C are as before and R is a temporal\nrelation between two activities A and B following the algebra\nproposed by Allen [23]. In this case, as the proposed process\nonly has registered end timestamps, only precedence (after, be-\nfore) relationships can be expressed. The relationship between\ntwo events a and b can be computed as:\nra,b(x) =\n(\n0,\nactivities not causally related\nTa −Tb,\nactivities are causally related\n(9)\nSo ra,b is zero if events are not causally related, positive\nif origin event precedes destination event and negative if\ndestination event precedes origin event. R can be computed for\neach pair of activities (for all the executions of each activity) in\nthe process (in both directions A before B, B before A). This\nway, linguistic variable \"after\" could be described as a series\nof positive, non monotonous fuzzy sets after = [immediately\nafter, shortly after, after, long after, at some point after]. And\n\"before\" in a similar way but with negative, non monotonous\nsets. This makes for a similar truth evaluation process as\nbefore, where truth degree for (7) is computed following [17]\nand for (8) with (6) substituting P for R in both cases.\nThese descriptions give an easy understanding of the be-\nhaviour and different paths (control-ﬂow perspective) patients\nfollow in the process, plus, the addition of the wait time\nbetween events (time perspective) allows medical experts to\ndetermine whether the behavior of the process is being as\nexpected, where excessive wait times are happening and how\nactivities relate among them.\nC. Deviance protoforms\nThese protoforms aim at putting in relevance attributes\nwhich may be causing deviance over other attributes. For\nexample \"In year 2019, most patients had a normal waiting\ntime between the MS session of the patient and its intervention.\nHowever, several patients with emergency admittance had a\nshort waiting time\". This protoform is indeed a composite\nprotoform, obtained by composing two protoforms: a type-I\ngeneral summary protoform with a type-II contrasting proto-\nform, through a semantic relation [14]. And it is deﬁned as:\nIn T, Q1 patients had attribute P1. However,\nQ2 patients with attribute C had attribute P2\n(10)\nA particular case of this protoform is one in which the ﬁrst\nstatement is made over the expected value of some attribute,\ndeﬁned by experts i.e. \"In year 2020, the waiting time between\nthe MS session of a patient and its intervention is expected to\nbe around 25 days. However, most patients from ambulatory\nadmittance had a longer waiting time\":\nIn T, P1 is expected. However,\nQ2 patients with attribute C had attribute P2\n(11)\nFor these protoforms, the truth value may be derived from\nthe aggregation of the truth values of its constituents through\nany t-norm. For simplicity and consistency we propose the use\nof the t-norm minimum. If we refer to the general protoform\nas S1 and to the contrasting protoform as S2 the truth value\nof the deviance protoform (10) can be computed as:\nT = T(S1) ∧T(S2)\n(12)\nwhere T(S1) and T(S2) can be computed with (4) and (5).\nFor protoform (11) where P1 is the expected value deﬁned by\nthe experts, there is no need to assess the truth degree of S1,\nas it will be always maximal. In this case, the truth degree of\nthe composite protoform is T(S2).\nOther protoform combinations are possible. Behavior de-\nviance descriptions like \"In year 2020, in most cases, the\nintervention of a patient takes place shortly after its MS\nsession. However, most patients with a low number of medical\ntests a second MS session takes place after the ﬁrst MS session\nis performed\" are of high interest for medical experts, as they\nallow them to detect bottlenecks and unexpected behaviours\nthat would otherwise remain unknown. Also, type-II proto-\nforms could be used for both protoforms, allowing to compare\ndifferent categories of patients for some attribute, e.g. \"In year\n2020, most male patients had a short waiting time between the\nMS session of the patient and its intervention. However, most\nfemale patients had a normal waiting time between the MS\nsession of the patient and its intervention\". These descriptions\nallow medical experts to easily grasp if differences between\ngroups of patients exist for certain attribute; as it may be their\nsex, type of admittance, treatment patient is being given, etc.\nD. Generation Pipeline\nOn the one hand, in LDD approaches, linguistic summaries\nare generated by a search (exhaustive or non-exhaustive)\nthrough the semantic space; the power set of all protoform\ninstances that can be built using the deﬁned quantiﬁers,\nqualiﬁers and summarizers guided by quality measures (truth\nvalue, strength of relation, etc.). On the other hand, D2T and\nNLG systems, as our proposal, follow a pipeline where the\nmain stages of the generation process related to handling of\ndata (data interpretation and document planning) use expert\nknowledge to determine which messages must be included and\nrealized into the ﬁnal text. This expert knowledge usually takes\nthe form of sets of rules, but other approaches as machine\nlearning, or statistical tests which in our case are used to\ndetermine whether a deviance protoform may present relevant\ninformation to the user, can be used.\nIV. VALIDATION AND CONCLUSIONS\nIn this section we present the assessment of the proposed\nmodel in a real domain of application (activities and attributes\nof the patients of a cardiac valvulopathy unit). The assess-\nment was conducted by medical experts of the Cardiology\nDepartment, University Hospital of Santiago de Compostela\nthrough a questionnaire, created by taking general ideas of\nthe Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) [24] adapted to\nlinguistic summarization that was used in [12].\nInstances of each type of protoform are presented to the\nexperts to assess the degree to which protoforms provide useful\ninformation in a comprehensible way (examples can be found\nin previous sections). Furthermore, the process model is also\nincluded to assess whether natural language descriptions are\npreferable or not to graphical representations. Finally, general\nquestions are asked in order to determine f the use of natural\nlanguage descriptions of processes in the health-care domain\nis found useful. All questions are asked on a ﬁve-level Likert\nscale ranging from ’strongly disagree’ to ’strongly agree’.\nResults show most protoforms are found to provide interest-\ning information, except those cases where routine information\nwas given. However, by proposing the same protoforms with\ndifferent data, we were able to recall that the perceived useful-\nness is only found lower when protoforms convey information\nmedical experts already know and not because the proposed\nprotoforms were not correct. When the information conveyed\nin the description is data unknown to medical experts, descrip-\ntions were labelled as really interesting. All protoforms, except\none case where the realization was not suitable, were found\ncomprehensible and easy to understand. In all cases where\nnatural language descriptions were confronted with graphical\nrepresentations, a clear preference was shown for natural\nlanguage descriptions. From the general questions, medical\nexperts clearly stated that natural language descriptions are\nuseful, give them a better understanding of what is happening\nin the process, allow them to complete tasks quicker, increase\nthe quality of their work and increase their effectiveness.\nIn this paper we present an approach to obtain natural\nlanguage descriptions of health-care processes. We propose\na series of protoforms which include temporal and causal in-\nformation from processes as well as patient attributes, that are\nable to quantify attributes in time during a process life-span,\nrecall causal relations and temporal distances between events,\nand describe whether differences exist in attributes between\ndifferent groups of patients. By introducing the temporal di-\nmension through imprecise descriptions of frequency and tem-\nporal characteristics of attributes and activities and through the\ncomposition of protoforms, the semantics and expressiveness\nof our proposal is greatly enhanced. We propose to generate\nthe descriptions using a novel approach based the D2T pipeline\nusing process-mining techniques and expert knowledge. A\nreal health-care use case is presented, showing the potential\nof the proposed protoforms for providing natural language\ndescriptions addressed to cardiology specialists about activities\nand attributes of the patients of a cardiac valvulopathy unit.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThanks to Dr. Carlos Peña and Dr. Violeta González from\nthe Department of Cardiology, University Clinical Hospital of\nSantiago de Compostela, SERGAS, Biomedical Research Cen-\nter in the Cardiovascular Diseases Network (CIBER-CV), for\nproviding the anonymized data and validating the proposal.\nREFERENCES\n[1] W.
