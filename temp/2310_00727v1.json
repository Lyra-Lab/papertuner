Introduction \n \n A new age in health care is rapidly approaching, one in which the wealth of biological \ndata will play an increasingly significant role. By considering various aspects of a patient's \ndata, such as variability in molecular traits, environment, electronic health records (EHRs), \nand lifestyle, precision medicine, for instance, aims to \"ensure that the right treatment is \ndelivered to the right patient at the right time.\" The abundance of biomedical data presents \nboth enormous potential and difficulties for health care research. To build trustworthy \nmedical solutions based on data-driven techniques and machine learning, a major difficulty \nis examining the relationships among all the many bits of information in these data sets. \nPrevious research has attempted to combine various data sources in order to create \ncollaborative knowledge bases that can be utilized for discovery and predictive analysis [19].  \nIn the medical field, which places enormous demands on human life, the healthcare \nservice system is crucial. Healthcare professionals in developing nations are using intelligent \ntechnology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning methods, to advance \ntheir professions. Healthcare innovation has influenced research on intelligent healthcare \nsystems that are oriented on people. AI technologies have an impact on how intensive care \nand administrative tasks are developed in hospitals and clinics. Since 2019, Jafar Abdollahi \nhas conducted extensive research in the area of disease diagnosis with artificial intelligence. \nAccording to his findings, artificial intelligence, including machine learning and deep \nlearning, has been successfully used in medical image and healthcare analysis for diseases \nlike Diabetes [1, 10, 18], Breast Cancer [2, 11], Healthcare System [3], Forecasting [4, Stock \nMarket [5], Stroke [6, COVID-19 [7], Types of the Epidemic [8, Medicinal Plants [9], and \nHeart [12]. \nDeep learning techniques haven't, however, been thoroughly examined for a wide \nvariety of medical issues that can benefit from their capabilities. Deep learning has numerous \nfeatures that might be used in the healthcare industry, including its better performance, end-\nto-end learning model with integrated feature learning, capacity to handle complicated and \nmulti-modality data, and more. The deep learning research community as a whole needs to \naddress a number of issues related to the characteristics of health care data (i.e., sparse, noisy, \nheterogeneous, and time-dependent), as well as the need for improved techniques and tools \nthat allow deep learning to interface with clinical decision support workflows. \nIn this article, we cover current and upcoming deep learning applications in medicine, \nemphasizing the crucial elements to have a substantial influence on health care. We do not \nwant to provide a thorough foundation on the technical aspects or widespread applications \nof deep learning. As a result, in the sections that follow, we'll give a brief overview of the \ngeneral deep learning framework, examine some of its applications in the medical field, and \ntalk about the advantages, drawbacks, and potential uses of these techniques in the context \nof precision medicine and next-generation health care. The taxonomy of popular deep \nlearning architectures for HCS data analysis is shown in Fig. 1, along with a few HCS \napplications, particularly one for illness detection [23]. \n \n \n \nFig 1. Application and Architectures of Deep Learning. \n \n2. Advantages of DL and ML in Medical Healthcare Data \nThe deep learning and machine learning are evolutionary changes in various fields such as \nindustry, companies, schools, colleges, and healthcare systems, and we can say that more \nchanges are seen in the medical line by providing many types of online and offline facilities. \nDeep learning plays an important role in the detection of cancer cells automatically. The ML \ncan solve multiple tasks but it needs human beings, while the DL performs alone or \nautomatically using machine learning. Deep learning solves the whole problem unlike ML \nautomatically. Deep learning is more beneficial for elders, coma patients, and cardiac disease \ndiagnosis, especially in case of children [22]. The application of AI and other approaches is \nshown in Figure 2. \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Applications of ML and DL in the healthcare system. \n2.1. Deep learning framework \nA general-purpose artificial intelligence technique called machine learning may infer \ncorrelations from data without first defining them. The key selling point is the capacity to generate \npredictive models without making firm assumptions about the underlying processes, which are often \nunidentified or inadequately characterized. Data harmonization, representation learning, model fitting, \nand assessment make up the usual machine learning pipeline. For many years, building a machine \nlearning system needed meticulous engineering and subject-matter knowledge to convert the raw data \ninto an appropriate internal representation from which the learning subsystem, often a classifier, could \nfind patterns in the data set. Conventional methods can only handle natural data in its raw form since \nthey only involve one, often linear, modification of the input space [19].  \n \nFig 3. Deep learning framework \n \n \nA. Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNS) \nThe FCNNs consist just of neurons and layers of models, where each layer's input is connected to \neach neuron in the one below. The most straightforward way to understand neurons is to conceive of \nthem as linear regression models, where each neuron uses input data (x), weights (y), and bias (z) to \ncreate an output (y). If the result after the activation function is zero, the neuron will be eliminated for \nthat particular instance. The neuron's value must pass through the activation function. In any other case, \nthe value will be sent to the network's next tier. Depending on the kind of activation function utilized, \nthe output value changes. For instance, the output of the sigmoid activation function will have an s-\nshaped curve and range between 0 and 1. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is another \nexample. For values greater than 0, it has a linear form, while for values less than or equal to 0, it has a \n0 [20].  \nB. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) \nThe most well-known and often used deep learning architecture for image data is CNN. CNNs \nare layers that use convolutional techniques to certain inputs to create specific outputs. In the \nconvolution process, filters are utilized as a sliding window to scan over all input areas and create a \nfeature map. To reduce the number of created features and subsequently the computation, pooling layers \nwith convolution layers are utilized in the downsampling process. The output often has a similar form \nto the input, which may be a tensor in one, two, or three dimensions. Many other CNN designs have \nbeen created over the years; among of the most well-known ones are LaNet, ResNet, VGGNET, \nEfficientNet, and others. CNNs are employed in numerous machines learning applications, including \nvideo processing, natural language processing (NLP), and time series prediction, in addition to being \nthe most widely used approach for image processing. In the last few years, CNN has also grown in \nprominence in BDL. They are utilized in a variety of applications, including medical imaging [20], text \ndetection, genomic research, and others. \nC. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNS) \nFor deep sequential learning, which is utilized for sequence or streaming data, such as video, \naudio, and time-series prediction, RNNs are one of the most often employed architectures [32]. The \nneurons in the same layer are connected in these networks by recurrent \"cycle\" linkages. RNNs include \nmemory cells that provide the model the ability to retain data from the past, which is crucial for \npredicting future events. In order to anticipate the output of the network, RNNs must maintain a state of \nthe past and current input. To put it another way, technically, computing the outcome requires \nknowledge of the status of every prior input. The vanishing gradient descent issue arises when the \nsequence becomes longer, making the starting weight unreachable and lowering the performance of the \nRNNs. As a result, many architectural designs have been created to address this problem; one such \ndesign is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) concept. Throughout the learning process, the LSTM \nis advised for managing each memory cell for both state and output values [20].  \n \n \n \n2.2. \nChallenges and opportunities \nDespite the encouraging outcomes produced by deep architectures, there are still a number of issues \nthat need to be resolved before deep learning in healthcare may be used clinically. We draw special \nattention to the following significant problems. [19]: \n• \nData volume: Deep learning describes a group of computer models that are very labor-\nintensive. Fully linked multi-layer neural networks are one common example, where several \nnetwork parameters must be accurately predicted. The availability of a vast quantity of data \nserves as the foundation for achieving this aim. Despite the fact that there are no strict rules \nregarding the minimum number of training documents, it is often recommended to use at least \n10 times as many samples as parameters in the network. This is also one of the explanations for \nwhy deep learning is so effective in fields like computer vision, voice, and natural language \nprocessing where massive amounts of data are amenable to easy collection. Although there are \nonly 7.5 billion people in the globe (as of September 2016), a large portion of them do not have \naccess to basic healthcare, making health care a separate field. As a result, we are unable to get \nenough patients to build a thorough deep learning model. Additionally, comprehending illnesses \nand their variations is a lot more difficult than other tasks, like voice or picture recognition. \nTherefore, in comparison to other media, the quantity of medical data required to train an \nefficient and reliable deep learning model would be much more from a big data viewpoint [19]. \n• \nData quality: Health care data are very varied, confusing, noisy, and incomplete, in contrast to \nother fields where the data are clean and well-structured. It is difficult to train an effective deep \nlearning model with such large and diverse data sets and must take into account a number of \nfactors, including data sparsity, redundancy, and missing values [19]. \n• \nTemporality: The illnesses constantly advance and change in a nondeterministic fashion across \ntime. However, a lot of current deep learning models—including some that have been suggested \nfor the medical field—assume static vector-based inputs, which do not naturally handle the time \naspect. The creation of unique solutions will be necessary for designing deep learning methods \nthat can handle temporal health care data [19]. \nDomain-level complexity the issues in bioscience and healthcare are trickier than in other application \nsectors (like voice and image analysis). Due to the extreme heterogeneity of the illnesses, it is still \nunclear exactly what causes most of them and how they develop. Furthermore, in a real-world clinical \nsetting, the number of patients is often constrained, therefore we are unable to request an unlimited \nnumber of patients. \n• \nInterpretability: Deep learning models are sometimes seen as \"black boxes,\" despite the fact \nthat they have proven effective in a number of application fields. While this might not be a \nproblem in other, more deterministic domains like image annotation (where the end user can \nobjectively validate the tags assigned to the images), in the field of health care, it is important \nto understand not only how well the algorithms perform quantitatively but also why they do so. \nIn fact, such model interpretability (i.e. revealing which phenotypes are driving the predictions) \nis essential for persuading the medical community to take the actions suggested by the predictive \nsystem (e.g. prescribing a specific medication, possibly having a high risk of contracting a \nspecific disease) [19]. \n \n3. Treatment Applications of ML \n a) Image interpretation \nAs was previously said, medical pictures are often employed in everyday clinical practice, and \nskilled radiologists and doctors analyze and interpret these images. They generate textual radiology \nreports on each bodily part that was evaluated in the performed research in order to describe the results \nabout the pictures being reviewed. Writing such reports, however, may be particularly difficult in certain \nsituations, such as for radiologists with less training or for healthcare practitioners in remote places \nwhere the standard of treatment is subpar. The process of creating high-quality reports, on the other \nhand, may be laborious and time-consuming for expert radiologists and pathologists, which can be made \nworse by the many patients that come in each day. As a result, several academics have made an effort \nto solve this issue utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) approaches. \n[21] proposes a technique for annotating clinical radiological data using natural language processing. \nFor the automated labeling and description of medical pictures, a multi-task machine learning (ML) \nbased architecture is suggested [21]. A similar work [21] presents an end-to-end architecture for thorax \nillness categorization and reporting in chest X-rays that was constructed using the combination of CNN \nand RNN. A unique multi-modal model for automated report production is created in [21] using an \nLSTM network and CNN. \nb) Real-time health monitoring using ML \nMonitoring critical patients in real time is essential and a fundamental step in the healing \nprocess. People are becoming more interested in continuous health monitoring via smartphones, IoT \nsensors, and wearable technology. A wearable gadget and a smartphone are often used to gather health \ndata for continuous health monitoring, which is subsequently sent to the cloud for ML/DL analysis. The \nresults are then sent back to the device so it may take the necessary action(s). For instance, [21] presents \na framework with a comparable system design. The system is created by fusing mobile and cloud for \nPPG signal-based heart rate monitoring. Similar to this, [21] presents a study of several ML approaches \nfor human activity identification with application to remote patient monitoring utilizing wearable \ntechnology. We go through several of the privacy and security issues raised by the sharing of health data \nwith clouds for further analysis in the next section. \n4. Conclusion \nDeep learning techniques are potent tools that enhance conventional machine learning and \nenable computers to learn from the data in order to find ways to develop smarter applications. A variety \nof applications, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing, have already exploited \nthese methods. The findings from every study that has been published in the literature demonstrate how \ndeep learning can also be used to analyze health care data. In fact, using multi-layer neural networks to \nhandle medical data boosted the prediction capacity for a number of particular applications across \nseveral clinical domains. Furthermore, given the emphasis on representation learning and not just \nclassification accuracy, deep architectures have the ability to integrate various data sets across disparate \ndata types and provide higher generalization due of their hierarchical learning structure [24-34]. \n \n \nReference \n[1] Abdollahi, J., Moghaddam, B.
