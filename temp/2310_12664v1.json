However, their expertise in the finan-\ncial domain lacks a comprehensive evalua-\ntion. To assess the ability of LLMs to solve\nfinancial NLP tasks, we present FinLMEval,\na framework for Financial Language Model\nEvaluation, comprising nine datasets designed\nto evaluate the performance of language mod-\nels. This study compares the performance of\nencoder-only language models and the decoder-\nonly language models. Our findings reveal that\nwhile some decoder-only LLMs demonstrate\nnotable performance across most financial tasks\nvia zero-shot prompting, they generally lag be-\nhind the fine-tuned expert models, especially\nwhen dealing with proprietary datasets. We\nhope this study provides foundation evaluations\nfor continuing efforts to build more advanced\nLLMs in the financial domain.\n1\nIntroduction\nRecent progress in natural language processing\n(NLP) demonstrates that large language models\n(LLMs), like ChatGPT, achieve impressive results\non various general domain NLP tasks.\nThose\nLLMs are generally trained by first conducting\nself-supervised training on the unlabeled text (Rad-\nford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Touvron\net al., 2023a) and then conducting instruction tun-\ning (Wang et al., 2023; Taori et al., 2023) or rein-\nforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)\n(Ouyang et al., 2022) to let them perform tasks\nfollowing human instructions.\nFinancial NLP, in contrast, demands specialized\nknowledge and specific reasoning skills to tackle\ntasks within the financial domain. However, for\ngeneral language models like ChatGPT, their self-\nsupervised training is performed on the text from\nvarious domains, and the reinforcement learning\nfeedback they receive is generated by non-expert\nworkers. Therefore, how much essential knowledge\nand skills are acquired during the learning process\nremains uncertain. As a result, a comprehensive\ninvestigation is necessary to assess its performance\non financial NLP tasks.\nTo fill this research gap, we are motivated to\nevaluate language models on financial tasks com-\nprehensively. For doing so, we propose a frame-\nwork for Financial Language Model Evaluation\n(FinLMEval). We collected nine datasets on fi-\nnancial tasks, five from public datasets evaluated\nbefore. However, for those public datasets, it is\npossible that their test sets are leaked during the\ntraining process or provided by the model users\nas online feedback. To eliminate this issue, We\nused four proprietary datasets on different financial\ntasks: financial sentiment classification (FinSent),\nenvironmental, social, and corporate governance\nclassification (ESG), forward-looking statements\nclassification (FLS), and question-answering clas-\nsification (QA) for evaluation.\nIn the evaluation benchmark, we evaluate the\nencoder-only language models with supervised\nfine-tuning, with representatives of BERT (Devlin\net al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), FinBERT\n(Yang et al., 2020) and FLANG (Shah et al., 2022).\nWe then compare the encoder-only models with the\ndecoder-only models, with representatives of Chat-\nGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023),\nPIXIU (Xie et al., 2023), LLAMA2-7B (Touvron\net al., 2023b) and Bloomberg-GPT (Wu et al., 2023)\nby zero-shot prompting. Besides, we evaluate the\nefficacy of in-context learning of ChatGPT with\ndifferent in-context sample selection strategies.\nExperiment results show that (1) the fine-tuned\ntask-specific encoder-only model generally per-\nforms better than decoder-only models on the fi-\nnancial tasks, even if decoder-only models have\nmuch larger model size and have gone through\nmore pre-training and instruction tuning or RLHF;\n(2) when the supervised data is insufficient, the\narXiv:2310.12664v1  [cs.CL]  19 Oct 2023\nGet response with Prompt:\nPerform financial sentiment classification. \nClassify the following sentence into \n'neutral',' positive', or 'negative' class. \nOnly provide the label in the output. \n{placeholder}\nThe sentence: Energy-\nRelated Investments \nreported a 277% \nincrease in quarterly \nearnings.

Compared to\nprevious benchmarks in the financial domain like\nFLUE (Shah et al., 2022), our evaluation includes\nfour new datasets and involves more advanced\nLLMs like ChatGPT. We show that even the most\nadvanced LLMs still fall behind the fine-tuned ex-\npert models. We hope this study contributes to the\ncontinuing efforts to build more advanced LLMs\nin the financial domain.\n2\nRelated Works\nThe utilization of language models in financial NLP\nis a thriving research area. While some general do-\nmain language models, like BERT (Devlin et al.,\n2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), GPT (Brown\net al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023) and LLAMA (Tou-\nvron et al., 2023a,b) have been applied to finan-\ncial NLP tasks, financial domain models like Fin-\nBERT (Araci, 2019; Yang et al., 2020; Huang et al.,\n2023), FLANG (Shah et al., 2022), PIXIU (Xie\net al., 2023), InvestLM (Yang et al., 2023) and\nBloombergGPT (Wu et al., 2023) are specifically\ndesigned to contain domain expertise and generally\nperform better in financial tasks. Recent work such\nas FLUE (Shah et al., 2022) has been introduced to\nbenchmark those language models in the finance\ndomain. However, the capability of more advanced\nLLMs, like ChatGPT and GPT-4, has not been\nbenchmarked, especially on proprietary datasets.\nIn this work, in addition to the public tasks used\nin FLUE, we newly include four proprietary tasks\nin FinLMEval and conduct comprehensive evalua-\ntions for those financial language models.\n3\nMethods\nWe compare two types of models in FinLMEval:\nthe Transformers encoder-only models that require\nfine-tuning on the labeled dataset, and decoder-only\nmodels that are prompted with zero-shot or few-\nshot in-context instructions. Figure 1 provides an\noutline of evaluation methods of FinLMEval.\n3.1\nEncoder-only Models\nOur experiments explore the performance of vari-\nous notable encoder-only models: BERT (Devlin\net al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), FinBERT\n(Yang et al., 2020) and FLANG (Shah et al., 2022).\nBERT and RoBERTa are pre-trained on general\ndomain corpora, while FinBERT and FLANG are\npre-trained on a substantial financial domain cor-\npus. We fine-tune the language models on specific\ntasks. Following the fine-tuning process, inference\ncan be performed on the fine-tuned models for spe-\ncific applications.\n# train\n# test\nsource\ndescription\nFinSent\n8996\n1000\n-\nFinancial sentiment classification dataset from analyst reports.\nFPB\n2453\n1000\n(Malo et al., 2014)\nSentiment classification dataset from financial news.\nFiQA SA\n973\n200\n(FiQA)\nAspect-based financial sentiment analysis.\nESG\n3000\n1000\n-\nEnvironmental, social, and corporate governance classification dataset.\nFLS\n2600\n1000\n-\nForward-looking statements classification dataset from corporate reports.\nQA\n868\n200\n-\nClassification on the validity of question-answering pairs.\nHeadlines\n9570\n1000\n(Sinha and Khandait, 2020)\nMulitple tasks classification dataset from news headlines.\nNER\n14041\n1000\n(Alvarado et al., 2015)\nNamed entity recognition on financial agreements.\nFOMC\n1831\n450\n(Shah et al., 2023)\nHawkish-dovish monetary policy classification from FOMC documents.\nTable 1: The summarization of nine datasets in FinLMEval.

ChatGPT and GPT-4, developed by Ope-\nnAI, are two advanced LLMs that showcase ex-\nceptional language understanding and generation\nabilities. The models are pre-trained on a wide\narray of textual data and reinforced by human feed-\nback. PIXIU is a financial LLM based on fine-\ntuning LLAMA (Touvron et al., 2023a) with in-\nstruction data. LLAMA2 is a popular open-sourced\nLLM pre-trained on extensive online data, and\nBloombergGPT is an LLM for finance trained on\na wide range of financial data. As the model size\nof the evaluated decoder-only models is extremely\nlarge, they usually do not require fine-tuning the\nwhole model on downstream tasks. Instead, the\ndecoder-only models provide answers via zero-shot\nand few-shot in-context prompting.\nWe conduct zero-shot prompting for all decoder-\nonly models. We manually write the prompts for\nevery task. An example of prompts for the senti-\nment classification task is provided in Figure 1, and\nthe manual prompts for other tasks are provided\nin Appendix A. Furthermore, to evaluate whether\nfew-shot in-context learning can improve the model\nperformance, we also conduct in-context learning\nexperiments on ChatGPT. We use two strategies\nto select the in-context examples for few-shot in-\ncontext learning: random and similar. The former\nstrategy refers to random selection, and the lat-\nter selects the most similar sentence regarding the\nquery sentence. All in-context examples are se-\nlected from the training set, and one example is\nprovided from each label class.\n4\nDatasets\nOur evaluation relies on nine datasets designed\nto evaluate the financial expertise of the models\nfrom diverse perspectives. Table 1 overviews the\nnumber of training and testing samples and the\nsource information for each dataset. Below, we\nprovide an introduction to each of the nine datasets.\nFinSent is a newly collected sentiment classifica-\ntion dataset containing 10,000 manually annotated\nsentences from analyst reports of S&P 500 firms.\nFPB Sentiment Classification (Malo et al.,\n2014) is a classic sentiment dataset of sentences\nfrom financial news. The dataset consists of 4840\nsentences divided by the agreement rate of 5-8 an-\nnotators. We use the subset of 75% agreement.\nFiQA SA (FiQA) is a aspect-based financial sen-\ntiment analysis dataset. Following the \"Sentences\nfor QA-M\" method in (Sun et al., 2019), for each\n(sentence, target, aspect) pair, we transform the\nsentence into the form \"what do you think of the\n{aspect} of {target}? {sentence}\" for classification.\nESG evaluates an organizationâ€™s considerations\non environmental, social, and corporate gover-\nnance. We collected 2,000 manually annotated\nsentences from firmsâ€™ ESG reports and annual re-\nports.\nFLS, the forward-looking statements, are beliefs\nand opinions about a firmâ€™s future events or re-\nsults. FLS dataset, aiming to classify whether a\nsentence contains forward-looking statements, con-\ntains 3,500 manually annotated sentences from the\nManagement Discussion and Analysis section of\nannual reports of Russell 3000 firms.\nQA contains question-answering pairs extracted\nfrom earnings conference call transcripts. The goal\nof the dataset is to identify whether the answer is\nvalid to the question.\nHeadlines (Sinha and Khandait, 2020) is a\ndataset for the commodity market that analyzes\nDatasets\nEncoder-only Models\nDecoder-only Models\nBERT\nRoBERTa\nFinBERT\nFLANG-\nBERT\nChatGPT\nGPT-4\nPIXIU\nLLAMA2-\n7B\nBloomberg-\nGPT\nFinSent\n0.841\n0.871\n0.851\n0.849\n0.782\n0.809\n0.800\n0.243\n-\nFPB\n0.914\n0.934\n0.912\n0.881\n0.869\n0.905\n0.965\n0.339\n0.511\nFiQA SA\n0.750\n0.875\n0.805\n0.695\n0.898\n0.920\n0.930\n0.480\n0.751\nESG\n0.931\n0.956\n0.958\n0.925\n0.477\n0.626\n0.509\n0.209\n-\nFLS\n0.875\n0.862\n0.882\n0.861\n0.652\n0.565\n0.275\n0.365\n-\nQA\n0.865\n0.825\n0.825\n0.785\n0.695\n0.775\n0.680\n0.625\n-\nHeadlines-PDU\n0.937\n0.947\n0.956\n0.940\n0.889\n0.878\n0.842\n0.411\n-\nHeadlines-PDC\n0.978\n0.979\n0.981\n0.978\n0.936\n0.947\n0.702\n0.053\n-\nHeadlines-PDD\n0.954\n0.961\n0.960\n0.956\n0.896\n0.900\n0.763\n0.382\n-\nHeadlines-PI\n0.974\n0.964\n0.976\n0.977\n0.225\n0.105\n0.753\n0.966\n-\nHeadlines-AC\n0.996\n0.993\n0.997\n0.995\n0.806\n0.838\n0.902\n0.346\n-\nHeadlines-FI\n0.976\n0.964\n0.976\n0.974\n0.711\n0.780\n0.981\n0.048\n-\nHeadlines-PS\n0.905\n0.918\n0.924\n0.906\n0.630\n0.811\n0.776\n0.546\n-\nNER\n0.980\n0.981\n0.964\n0.978\n0.748\n0.707\n0.749\n0.714\n0.608\nFOMC\n0.587\n0.611\n0.602\n0.602\n0.633\n0.729\n0.522\n0.349\n-\nAverage\n0.897\n0.909\n0.905\n0.907\n0.723\n0.753\n0.739\n0.405\n-\nTable 2: The results of fine-tuned encoder-only models and zero-shot decoder-only models in 9 financial datasets.\nThe results, except the NER dataset, are measured in micro-F1 score.

We use the BERT\n(base,uncased), RoBERTa (base), FinBERT (pre-\ntrain), and FLANG-BERT from Huggingface1, and\nthe model fine-tuning is implemented via Trainer 2.\nFor all tasks, we fix the learning rate as 2 Ã— 10âˆ’5,\nweight decay as 0.01, and the batch size as 48. We\nrandomly select 10% examples from the training\nset as the validation set for model selection and\n1https://huggingface.co/\n2https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/\nmain_classes/trainer\nfine-tune the model for three epochs. Other hyper-\nparameters remain the default in Trainer.\nDecoder-only models setups. In the zero-shot\nsetting, for ChatGPT and GPT-4, We use the \"gpt-\n3.5-turbo\" and \"gpt-4\" model API from OpenAI,\nrespectively. We set the temperature and top_p\nas 1, and other hyperparameters default by Ope-\nnAI API. The ChatGPT results are retrieved from\nthe May 2023 version, and the GPT-4 results\nare retrieved in August 2023.\nFor PIXIU and\nLLAMA2, we use the \"ChanceFocus/finma-7b-\nnlp\" and \"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b\" models from\nHuggingface. The model responses are generated\ngreedily. All prompts we used in the zero-shot\nsetting are shown in Appendix A. Besides, as the\nBloombergGPT (Wu et al., 2023) is not publicly\navailable, we directly adopt the results from the\noriginal paper.\nFor in-context learning, we conduct two strate-\ngies for in-context sample selection: random and\nsimilar. We select one example from each label\nwith equal probability weighting for random sam-\nple selection. For similar sample selection, we get\nthe sentence embeddings by SentenceTransformer\n(Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) \"all-MiniLM-L6-\nv2\" model3 and use cosine similarity as the measure\nof similarity.

The prompts for in-context\nlearning are directly extended from the correspond-\ning zero-shot prompts, with the template shown in\nFigure 1.\n5.2\nMain Results\nTable 2 compares the results of the fine-tuned\nencoder-only models and zero-shot decoder-only\nmodels in 9 financial datasets. We have the follow-\ning findings:\nIn 6 out of 9 datasets, fine-tuned encoder-\nonly models can perform better than decoder-\nonly models. The decoder-only models, especially\nthose that have experienced RLHF or instruction-\ntuning, demonstrate considerable performance on\nzero-shot settings on the financial NLP tasks. How-\never, their performance generally falls behind the\nfine-tuned language models, implying that these\nlarge language models still have the potential to im-\nprove their financial expertise. On the other hand,\nfine-tuned models are less effective when the\ntraining examples are insufficient (FiQA SA) or\nimbalanced (FOMC).\nThe performance gaps between fine-tuned\nmodels and zero-shot LLMs are larger on pro-\nprietary datasets than publicly available ones.\nFor example, the FinSent, FPB, and FiQA SA\ndatasets are comparable and all about financial sen-\ntiment classification. However, zero-shot LLMs\nperform the worst on the proprietary dataset Fin-\nSent. The performance gaps between fine-tuned\nmodels and zero-shot LLMs are also more signifi-\ncant on other proprietary datasets (ESG, FLS, and\nQA) than the public dataset.\nTable 3 compares the zero-shot and in-context\nfew-shot learning of ChatGPT. In ChatGPT, the\nzero-shot and few-shot performances are com-\nparable in most cases. When zero-shot prompting\nis ineffective, adding demonstrations can improve\nChatGPTâ€™s performance by clarifying the task, as\nthe results of ESG and Headlines-PI tasks show.\nDemonstrations are ineffective for easy and well-\ndefined tasks, such as sentiment classifications and\nHeadlines (PDU, PDC, PDD, AC, and FI), as the\nzero-shot prompts clearly instruct ChatGPT.\n6\nConclusions\nWe present FinLMEval, an evaluation framework\nfor financial language models. FinLMEval com-\nprises nine datasets from the financial domain, and\nwe conduct the evaluations on various popular lan-\nguage models. Our results show that fine-tuning\nexpert encoder-only models generally perform bet-\nter than the decoder-only LLMs on the financial\nNLP tasks, and adding in-context demonstrations\nbarely improves the results.\nOur findings sug-\ngest that there remains room for enhancement for\nmore advanced LLMs in the financial NLP field.\nOur study provides foundation evaluations for con-\ntinued progress in developing more sophisticated\nLLMs within the financial sector.\n7\nLimitations\nThis paper has several limitations to improve in\nfuture research. First, our evaluation is limited\nto some notable language models, while other ad-\nvanced LLMs may exhibit different performances\nfrom our reported models. Also, as the LLMs keep\nevolving and improving over time, the future ver-\nsions of the evaluated models can have different\nperformance from the reported results. Second,\nFinLMEval only focuses on financial classification\ntasks, and the analysis of the generation ability of\nthe LLMs still needs to be included. Future work\ncan be done toward developing evaluation bench-\nmarks on generation tasks in the financial domain.\nReferences\nJulio Cesar Salinas Alvarado, Karin Verspoor, and Timo-\nthy Baldwin. 2015.
