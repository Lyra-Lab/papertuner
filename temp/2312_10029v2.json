The\nidea behind unsupervised knowledge elicitation is that knowledge satisfies a consistency structure,\nwhich can be used to discover knowledge. We first prove theoretically that arbitrary features (not just\nknowledge) satisfy the consistency structure of a particular leading unsupervised knowledge-elicitation\nmethod, contrast-consistent search (Burns et al., 2023). We then present a series of experiments\nshowing settings in which unsupervised methods result in classifiers that do not predict knowledge,\nbut instead predict a different prominent feature. We conclude that existing unsupervised methods for\ndiscovering latent knowledge are insufficient, and we contribute sanity checks to apply to evaluating\nfuture knowledge elicitation methods. Conceptually, we hypothesise that the identification issues\nexplored here, e.g. distinguishing a model’s knowledge from that of a simulated character’s, will persist\nfor future unsupervised methods.\n1. Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) perform well across a variety of tasks (Chowdhery et al., 2022; OpenAI,\n2023) in a way that suggests they systematically incorporate information about the world (Bubeck\net al., 2023). As a shorthand for the real-world information encoded in the weights of an LLM we\ncould say that the LLM encodes knowledge.\nHowever, accessing that knowledge is challenging, because the factual statements an LLM outputs\ndo not always describe that knowledge (Askell et al., 2021; Kenton et al., 2021; Park et al., 2023). For\nexample, it might repeat common misconceptions (Lin et al., 2021) or strategically deceive its users\n(Scheurer et al., 2023). If we could elicit the latent knowledge of an LLM (Christiano et al., 2021) it\nwould allow us to detect and mitigate dishonesty, in which an LLM outputs text which contradicts\nknowledge encoded in it (Evans et al., 2021). It could also improve scalable oversight by making AI\nactions clearer to humans, making it easier to judge if those actions are good or bad. Last, it could\nimprove scientific understanding of the inner workings of LLMs.\nRecent work introduces a learning algorithm—contrast-consistent search (CCS) (Burns et al.,\n2023)—to discover latent knowledge in LLMs without supervision, which is important because we\nlack a ground truth for what the model knows, as opposed to what we think we know. Their key\nclaims are that knowledge satisfies a consistency structure, formulated as the CCS loss function, that\nfew other features in an LLM are likely to satisfy, and hence the classifier elicits latent knowledge.\nWe refute these claims by identifying classes of features in an LLM that also satisfy this consistency\nstructure but are not knowledge. We prove two theoretical results: firstly that a class of arbitrary binary\nclassifiers are optimal under the CCS loss; secondly that there is a CCS loss-preserving transformation\nto an arbitrary classifier. The upshot is that the CCS consistency structure is more than just slightly\nimprecise in identifying knowledge—it is compatible with arbitrary patterns.\nCorresponding author(s): sebfar,vikrantvarma,zkenton@google.com\n© 2023 Google DeepMind.

Left: We apply two transformations to a dataset of movie reviews, 𝑞𝑖. First (novel\nto us) we insert a distracting feature by appending either “Alice thinks it’s positive” or “Alice thinks\nit’s negative” at random to each question. Second, we convert each of these texts into contrast pairs\n(Burns et al., 2023), (𝑥+\n𝑖, 𝑥−\n𝑖), appending “It is positive” or “It is negative”. Middle: We then pass\nthese contrast pairs into the LLM and extract activations, 𝜙. Right: We do unsupervised learning on\nthe activations. We show a PCA visualisation of the activations. Without “Alice ...” inserted, we learn\na classifier (taken along the 𝑋= 0 boundary) for the review (orange/blue). However, with “Alice ...”\ninserted the review gets ignored and we instead learn a classifier for Alice’s opinion (light/dark).\nWe then show empirically that in practice CCS, and other unsupervised methods, do not discover\nknowledge. The first two experiments illustrated in Figure 1 introduce distracting features which\nare learnt instead of knowledge. In the third experiment, rather than inserting a distracting feature\nexplicitly, instead there is a character with an implicit opinion—the methods sometimes learn to\npredict this character’s opinion. In the fourth experiment we demonstrate the sensitivity of the\nmethods to unimportant details of the prompt. In the fifth experiment we show that, despite very\ndifferent principles, CCS makes similar predictions to PCA, illustrating that CCS is not exploiting\nconsistency structure of knowledge and motivating the possible generalisation of experimental results\nto future methods.\nWe conclude that existing unsupervised methods for discovering latent knowledge are insufficient\nin practice, and we contribute sanity checks to apply to evaluating future knowledge elicitation\nmethods. We hypothesise that our conclusions will generalise to more sophisticated methods, though\nperhaps not the exact experimental results: we think that unsupervised learning approaches to\ndiscovering latent knowledge which use some consistency structure of knowledge will likely suffer\nfrom similar issues to what we show here. Even more sophisticated methods searching for properties\nassociated with a model’s knowledge seem to us to be likely to encounter false positives such as\n“simulations” of other entities’ knowledge.\nOur key contributions are as follows:\n• We prove that arbitrary features satisfy the CCS loss equally well.\n• We show that unsupervised methods detect prominent features that are not knowledge.\n• We show that the features discovered by unsupervised methods are sensitive to prompts and\nthat we lack principled reasons to pick any particular prompt.\n2\nChallenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery\n2. Background\nContrastive LLM activations\nWe focus on methods that train probes (Alain and Bengio, 2016)\nusing LLM activation data. The LLM activation data is constructed using contrast pairs (Burns et al.,\n2023). They begin with a dataset of binary questions, 𝑄= {𝑞𝑖}𝑁\n𝑖=1, such as 𝑞𝑖= “Are cats mammals?”,\nand produce a dataset, 𝑋= {(𝑥+\n𝑖, 𝑥−\n𝑖)}𝑁\n𝑖=1, of pairs of input texts: 𝑥+\n𝑖= “Are cats mammals? Yes” and\n𝑥−\n𝑖= “Are cats mammals? No”. We then form activation data using 𝑥+\n𝑖(and 𝑥−\n𝑖) as inputs to the LLM,\nand read out an intermediate layer’s activations, 𝜙(𝑥+\n𝑖) (and 𝜙(𝑥−\n𝑖)). A normalisation step is then\nperformed to remove the prominent feature of 𝑥+\n𝑖ends with “Yes” and 𝑥−\n𝑖ends with “No”:\n˜𝜙(𝑥+\n𝑖) B\n𝜙(𝑥+\n𝑖) −𝜇+\n𝜎+\n;\n˜𝜙(𝑥−\n𝑖) B\n𝜙(𝑥−\n𝑖) −𝜇−\n𝜎−\nwhere 𝜇+, 𝜎+ and 𝜇−, 𝜎−are the mean and standard deviation of {𝜙(𝑥+\n𝑖)}𝑁\n𝑖=1 and {𝜙(𝑥−\n𝑖)}𝑁\n𝑖=1 respectively.\nThis forms a dataset of contrastive LLM activations, 𝐷= { ˜𝜙(𝑥+\n𝑖), ˜𝜙(𝑥−\n𝑖)}𝑁\n𝑖=1 for which we learn an\nunsupervised classifier, 𝑓: 𝑄→{0, 1}, mapping a question to a binary truth value. Our datasets have\nreference answers, 𝑎𝑖, which we use to evaluate the accuracy of the classifier.\nContrast-consistent Search (CCS)\nBurns et al. (2023) hypothesise that if knowledge is represented\nin LLMs it is probably represented as credences which follow the laws of probability. To softly encode\nthis constraint this, they train a probe 𝑝(𝑥) = 𝜎(𝜃𝑇˜𝜙(𝑥) + 𝑏) (a linear projection of the activation\nfollowed by a sigmoid function) to minimise the loss\nLCCS =\n𝑁\n∑︁\n𝑖=1\nLcons + Lconf\nLcons =\n\u0002\n𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖) −(1 −𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖))\n\u00032\nLconf = min\n\b\n𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖), 𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖)\n\t2 .\nThe motivation is that the Lcons encourages negation-consistency (that a statement and its negation\nshould have probabilities that add to one), and Lconf encourages confidence to avoid 𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖) ≈𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖) ≈\n0.5. For inference on a question 𝑞𝑖the average prediction is ˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) =\n\u0002\n𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖) + (1 −𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖))\n\u0003\n/2 and then\nthe induced classifier is 𝑓𝑝(𝑞𝑖) = I [˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) > 0.5]. Because the predictor itself learns the contrast between\nactivations, not the absolute classes, Burns et al. (2023) assume they can tell the truth and falsehood\ndirection by taking 𝑓𝑝(𝑞𝑖) = 1 to correspond to label 𝑎𝑖= 1 if the accuracy is greater than 0.5 (else it\ncorresponds to 𝑎𝑖= 0). We call this truth-disambiguation.\nOther methods\nWe consider two other unsupervised learning methods. The first is based on\nPCA, and is introduced in Burns et al. (2023) as contrastive representation clustering top principal\ncomponent (CRC-TPC)1. It uses the difference in contrastive activations, { ˜𝜙(𝑥+\n𝑖) −˜𝜙(𝑥−\n𝑖)}𝑁\n𝑖=1 as a\ndataset, performs PCA, and then classifies by thresholding the top principal component at zero. The\nsecond method is k-means, which is applied using two clusters. In both cases, truth-directions are\ndisambiguated using the truth-disambiguation described above (Burns et al., 2023).\nFollowing Burns et al. (2023) we also use logistic regression on concatenated contrastive activations,\n{( ˜𝜙(𝑥+\n𝑖), ˜𝜙(𝑥−\n𝑖))}𝑁\n𝑖=1 with labels 𝑎𝑖, and treat this as a ceiling (since it uses labeled data). Following\nRoger (2023) we compare to a random baseline using a probe with random parameter values, treating\nthat as a floor (as it does not learn from input data). Further details of all methods are in Appendix B.3.\n1Emmons (2023) point out that this is roughly 97-98% as effective as CCS according to the experiments in Burns\net al. (2023), suggesting that contrast pairs and standard unsupervised learning are doing much of the work, and CCS’s\nconsistency loss may not be very important. Our experiments in this paper largely agree with this finding.\n3\nChallenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery\n3. Theoretical Results\nOur two theoretical results show that CCS’s consistency structure isn’t specific to knowledge. The\nfirst theorem shows that arbitrary binary features of questions can be used as a classifier to achieve\noptimal performance under the CCS objective. This implies that arguments for CCS’s effectiveness\ncannot be grounded in conceptual or principled motivations from the loss construction.\nTheorem 1. Let feature ℎ: 𝑄→{0, 1}, be any arbitrary map from questions to binary outcomes. Let\n(𝑥+\n𝑖, 𝑥−\n𝑖) be the contrast pair corresponding to question 𝑞𝑖. Then the probe defined as 𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖) = ℎ(𝑞𝑖),\nand with 𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖) = 1 −ℎ(𝑞𝑖), achieves optimal loss, and the averaged prediction satisfies ˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) =\n\u0002\n𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖) + (1 −𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖))\n\u0003\n/2 = ℎ(𝑞𝑖).\nThat is, the classifier that CCS finds is under-specified: for any binary feature, ℎ, on the questions,\nthere is a probe with optimal CCS loss that induces that feature. The proof comes directly from\ninserting our constructive probes into the loss definition—equal terms cancel to zero (see Appendix A).\nIn Thm. 1, the probe 𝑝is binary since ℎis binary. In practice, since probe outputs are produced by\na sigmoid, they are in the exclusive range (0, 1).\nOur second theorem relaxes the restriction to binary probes and proves that any CCS probe can\nbe transformed into an arbitrary probe with identical CCS loss. We prove this theorem with respect\nto a corrected, symmetrized version of the CCS loss—also used in our experiments—which fixes an\nun-motivated downwards bias in the loss proposed by Burns et al. (2023) (see Appendix A.2 for\ndetails). We use the notation ⊕to denote a continuous generalisation of exclusive or on functions\n𝑎(𝑥), 𝑏(𝑥):\n(𝑎⊕𝑏)(𝑥) B [1 −𝑎(𝑥)] 𝑏(𝑥) + [1 −𝑏(𝑥)] 𝑎(𝑥).\nTheorem 2. Let 𝑔: 𝑄→{0, 1}, be any arbitrary map from questions to binary outputs. Let (𝑥+\n𝑖, 𝑥−\n𝑖)\nbe the contrast pair corresponding to question 𝑞𝑖. Let 𝑝be a probe, whose average result ˜𝑝=\n[𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖)+(1−𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖))]\n2\ninduces a classifier 𝑓𝑝(𝑞𝑖) = I [˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) > 0.5]. Define a transformed probe 𝑝′(𝑥+/−\n𝑖\n) =\n𝑝(𝑥+/−\n𝑖\n) ⊕\n\u0002\n𝑓𝑝(𝑞𝑖) ⊕𝑔(𝑞𝑖)\n\u0003. For all such transformed probes, LCCS(𝑝′) = LCCS(𝑝) and 𝑝′ induces the\narbitrary classifier 𝑓𝑝′(𝑞𝑖) = 𝑔(𝑞𝑖).\nThat is, for any original probe, there is an arbitrary classifier encoded by a probe with identical\nCCS loss to the original.\nThese theorems prove that optimal arbitrary probes exist, but not necessarily that they are actually\nlearned or that they are expressible in the probe’s function space. Which probe is actually learned\ndepends on inductive biases; these could depend on the prompt, optimization algorithm, or model\nchoice. None of these are things for which any robust argument ensures the desired behaviour.\nThe feature that is most prominent—favoured by inductive biases—could turn out to be knowledge,\nbut it could equally turn out to be the contrast-pair mapping itself (which is partly removed by\nnormalisation) or anything else. We don’t have any theoretical reason to think that CCS discovers\nknowledge probes. We now turn to demonstrating experimentally that, in practice, CCS can discover\nprobes for features other than knowledge.\n4. Experiments\nDatasets\nWe investigate three of the datasets that were used in Burns et al. (2023).2 We use the\nIMDb dataset of movie reviews classifying positive and negative sentiment (Maas et al., 2011), BoolQ\n2The others were excluded for legal reasons or because Burns et al. (2023) showed poor predictive accuracy using them.\n4\nChallenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery\n(Clark et al., 2019) answering yes/no questions about a text passage, and the binary topic-classification\ndataset DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007). Prompt templates for each dataset are given in Appendix B.1.\nWe use a single prompt template rather than the multiple used in Burns (2022), as we didn’t find\nmultiple templates to systematically improve performance of the methods, but increases experiment\ncomplexity, see Appendix C.5 for our investigation.\nLanguage Models\nWe use three different language models. In order to provide a direct comparison\nto Burns et al. (2023) we use one of the models they investigated, T5-11B, (Raffel et al., 2020)\nwith 11 billion parameters. We further use an instruction fine-tuned version of T5-11B called T5-\nFLAN-XXL, (Chung et al., 2022) to understand the effect of instruction fine-tuning. Both are encoder-\ndecoder architectures, and we use the encoder output for our activations. We also use Chinchilla-70B\n(Hoffmann et al., 2022), with 70 billion parameters, which is larger scale, and a decoder-only\narchitecture. We take activations from layer 30 (of 80) of this model, though see Appendix C.2.3 for\nresults on other layers, often giving similar results. Notably, K-means and PCA have good performance\nat layer 30 with less seed-variance than CCS, suggesting contrast pairs and standard unsupervised\nlearning, rather than the CCS consistency structure, are key (see Footnote 1).\nExperiment Setup\nIn each experiment we compare a default setting which is the same/similar to\nthat used in (Burns et al., 2023) to a modified setting that we introduce in order to show an effect –\ndiffering only in their text prompt. We then generate contrastive activations and train probes using\nthe methods in Section 2: CCS, PCA, k-means, random and logistic regression. Training details can\nbe found in Appendix B.3. For each method we use 50 random seeds. Our figures in general come in\ntwo types: violin plots which compare the accuracy of different methods; and three-dimensional PCA\nprojections of the activations to visualise how they are grouped. We show one dataset and model,\nrefer to the appendix for other datasets and models which often show similar results.\n4.1. Discovering random words\nOur first experiment, motivated by our theoretical results, introduces a distracting binary feature\nand shows the unsupervised methods discover this feature rather than knowledge. We focus here\non IMDB and Chinchilla (see Appendix C.1 for other datasets and models with similar results). Our\ndefault prompts use a standard template as in Burns et al. (2023):\nConsider the following example:\nProbably my all-time favorite movie, a story of...\nBetween positive and negative, the sentiment of this example is [label]\nDifferent questions differ in their review, inserted on the second line. The [label] “positive” or\n“negative” is inserted using the standard contrast pair procedure.\nOur modified prompts are formed from the above template by appending a full stop and space,\nthen one of two random words, “Banana” and “Shed”. In the language of Thm. 1 we take a random\npartition of question indices, {1, . . . , 𝑁} = 𝐼0 ∪𝐼1, with |𝐼0| = |𝐼1|, and set the binary feature ℎsuch\nthat ℎ(𝑞𝑖) = 0 for 𝑖∈𝐼0 and ℎ(𝑞𝑖) = 1 for for 𝑖∈𝐼1. “Banana” is inserted if ℎ(𝑞𝑖) = 0, and “Shed” is\ninserted if ℎ(𝑞𝑖) = 1. See Figure 1 for the structure of the modification – though here we append\n“Banana” or “Shed” to the end, rather than inserting “Alice...” in the middle.\nOur results are shown in Figure 2a, displaying accuracy of each method (x-axis groups). Default\nprompts are blue and modified banana/shed prompts are red. We look at the standard ground-truth\n5\nChallenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery\nPrompt template\nDefault\nBanana/Shed\nAccuracy \nbasis\n Ground truth\n Banana/Shed\nCCS\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nAccuracy\nPCA\nK-Means\nRandom\nLog.

We see that for all unsupervised methods, default prompts (blue) score\nhighly on ground truth accuracy (dark blue) in line with results in Burns et al. (2023). However, for\nthe banana/shed prompts we see 50%, random chance, on ground truth accuracy (dark red). On\nBanana/Shed accuracy (light red) both PCA and K-means score highly, while CCS shows a bimodal\ndistribution with a substantial number of seeds with 100% Banana/Shed accuracy – seeds differ\nonly in the random initialisation of the probe parameters. The takeaway is that CCS and other\nunsupervised methods don’t optimise for ground-truth knowledge, but rather track whatever feature\n(in this case, banana/shed) is most prominent in the activations.\nFigure 2b shows a visualisation of the top three components of PCA for the default (left) and\nmodified (right) prompts. In the modified case we see a prominent grouping of the data into dark/light\n(banana/shed) and, less prominently, into blue/orange (the review). This provides visual evidence\nthat both features (ground-truth and banana/shed) are represented, but the one which is most\nprominent in this case is banana/shed, in correspondence with Figure 2a.\n4.2. Discovering an explicit opinion\nIt is unlikely that such a drastic feature, ending with “Banana”/“Shed”, would actually exist in a\nreal dataset. These words had nothing to do with the rest of the text. In our second experiment\nwe consider a similar but more realistic modification, by inserting a character’s explicit opinion of\nwhether the review is positive or negative. What we will find is that the unsupervised methods learn\nto predict the character’s opinion, rather than classifying the sentiment of the actual review.\n6\nChallenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery\nPrompt template\nDefault\nAlice\nAccuracy \nbasis\n Ground truth\n Alice’s opinion\nCCS\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nAccuracy\nPCA\nK-means\nRandom\nLog.

(b) PCA visualisation of the activations,\nin default (left) and modified (right) settings, shows the clustering into Alice’s opinion (light/dark)\nrather than review sentiment (blue/orange).\nWe again focus here on IMDB and Chinchilla (see Appendix C.2.1 for other datasets and models\nwith similar results) and we use the same default prompt as before. For the modified setting we use a\nprompt style where Alice’s opinion is inserted into a random partition of questions:\nAlice is an expert at classifying the sentiment of movie reviews. Everyone agrees with her,\nand they always copy her answers. Consider the following review:\nProbably my all-time favorite movie, a story of...\nAlice thinks it is {positive | negative}.\nWhat do you think?\nI think it is [label]\nOur results are shown in Figure 3a. Default prompts are blue and modified prompts (containing\nAlice’s opinion) are red. We look at the standard ground-truth accuracy metric (dark), as well as “Alice\nAccuracy” metric (light) that measures whether “Alice thinks it is positive” or“Alice thinks it is negative”\nwas inserted. We see similar results as the previous experiment, that CCS and other unsupervised\nmethods don’t score high ground-truth accuracy, but rather score highly on Alice Accuracy, and further\nthat the CCS results are no longer bimodal.\nAlso shown in Figure 3b is a visualisation of the top three components of a PCA for the activations.\nWe see clearly the most prominent grouping of the data is into dark/light (Alice’s opinion) and that\nthese then have subgroups along blue/orange (the review).\nWhen we use a model that has been instruction-tuned (T5-FLAN-XXL) we see a similar pattern\nAppendix C.2.1 Figure 12, although a similarly clear result requires a more emphatic view from the\ncharacter by repeating the opinion (“I think it is positive. They fully express positive views. I’m sure\nyou also think it is positive. It’s clearly positive.”). An ablation of the number of repetitions can be\nfound in Appendix C.2.2, Figure 13.\n7\nChallenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery\nPrompt template\nDefault\nAnti-capitalist\nData subset\n Company\n Non-company\nCCS\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nAccuracy\nPCA\nKMeans\nRandom\nLog.

Discovering an implicit opinion\nThe previous experiment explicitly gave Alice’s opinion, “Alice thinks it is positive”. While this is more\nrealistic than Banana/Shed, it is still rather artificial in the sense we don’t expect real datasets to have\nsuch a clear syntactical textual binary feature. In the next experiment for the modified prompt we\ninstead explain Alice’s position in general, and keep that the same in all instances, making it more of\nan implicit, semantic rather than syntactic feature.\nWe use the DBpedia topic classification dataset (Auer et al., 2007) to construct a binary classification\ntask to classify the topic of a text from two choices. There are fourteen categories such as company,\nanimal, film. In the default case contrast pairs are constructed using a simple few-shot prompt setting\nup the task of identifying the topic of a sentence with the character “Alice” answering the questions\ncorrectly. In the modified setting3, Alice answers the few-shot examples correctly, except when topic\nis company – and in that case gives explanations like “[...] Alice always says the wrong answer when\nthe topic of the text is company, because she doesn’t like capitalism [...]”. What we are looking for\nis what the unsupervised methods predict on the final example when Alice has not yet stated an\nopinion: will it predict the correct answer, ignoring how Alice previously answered incorrectly about\ncompany; or will it predict Alice’s opinion, answering incorrectly about company.\nTo highlight the effect, we use a subset dataset where 50% of sentences are about “company”,\nand 50% have one of the remaining thirteen categories (non-company) as a topic. We apply truth-\ndisambiguation only to the subset with non-company topics, so that we can see the possible effect of\npredicting incorrectly on company data (otherwise the assignment might be flipped).\nOur results are shown in Figure 4. We look at default prompts (blue) and modified prompts (red)\nand split the data into whether the topic is company (dark) or non-company (light) and look at the\n3Full prompt templates are provided in Appendix B.1.3, Implicit Opinion: Default and Anti-capitalist.\n8\nChallenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery\nstandard ground-truth accuracy metric. The default setting (blue) produces high accuracy classifiers\nboth when the topic is company (dark blue) and other categories (light blue). In the modified setting\n(red) CCS gives a bimodal distribution when the topic is company (dark red), with almost half of the\nprobes (differing only in random initialisation) predicting Alice’s opinion, rather than the actual topic.\nIn contrast, it performs well over all other categories (light red) and so is not just an ordinary failure.\nOther unsupervised methods are less sensitive to the modified setting, scoring high accuracy when\nthe topic is company.\nHowever, when we visualise the first three PCA dimensions of the contrast pair activations\nFigure 4b we see four distinct clusters in the modified prompt case (right) showing how a detector\nmight cluster along either the topic (orange vs blue) or Alice’s opinion (light vs dark). This indicates\nthese unsupervised methods are still sensitive to the modified setting, it just isn’t evident from looking\nat the accuracy metric alone.\n4.4. Prompt template sensitivity\nThe next experiment is less artificial than the previous ones, in that we do not introduce a feature for\nthe unsupervised methods to discover. Instead, we look at three variations for a prompt template\nthat could naturally be chosen by a practitioner, and we will see that this leads to classifiers which\nhave rather different accuracies. We use TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021), a difficult question answering\ndataset which exploits the fact that LLMs tend to repeat common misconceptions.\nWe find that a “non-default” prompt gives the “best performance” in the sense of the highest\ntest-set accuracy. This highlights the reliance of unsupervised methods on implicit inductive biases\nwhich cannot be set in a principled way. It is not clear which prompt is the best one for eliciting\nthe model’s latent knowledge. Given that the choice of prompt appears to be a free variable with\nsignificant effect on the outcomes, any conceptual arguments about a principled loss or unsupervised\nsearch method do not imply that the resulting classifier has a principled foundation.\nIn our default setting we construct a contrast pair as follows\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer: {answer}\nTrue or false?\nThe answer is [label]\nThe [label] “true” or “false” is inserted using the standard contrast pair procedure. We consider two\nmodified settings. Firstly, the professor setting, where we prepend the text from Lin et al. (2021)4:\nProfessor Smith was given the following instructions: Interpret each question literally, and\nas a question about the real world; carefully research each answer, without falling prey to\nany common myths; and reply “I have no comment” unless you are completely certain of\nthe answer. Here are the Professor’s responses:\nWe used this text verbatim in order to make sure that we were looking at natural prompts that\npeople might ordinarily use without trying to see a specific result. We also consider a literal setting,\nremoving the opening and closing phrase about a Professor, just in case explicitly invoking a character\nis important.\n4Lin et al. (2021) found LLM generation performance improved using this prompt.\n9\nChallenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery\nCCS\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nAccuracy\nPCA\nKMeans\nRandom\nLog.

(b) PCA of the\nactivations based on ground truth, blue vs. orange, in the default (left), literal (middle) and professor\n(right) settings. We see don’t see ground truth clusters in the default setting, but see this a bit more\nin the literal and professor setting.\nResults are shown in Figure 5a for Chinchilla70B. The default setting (blue) gives worse accuracy\nthan the literal/professor (red, green) settings, especially for PCA and k-means. PCA visualisations\nare shown in Figure 5b, coloured by whether the question is True/False, in the default (left), literal\n(middle) and professor (right) settings. We see clearer clusters in the literal/professor settings. Other\nmodels are shown in Appendix C.4, with less systematic differences between prompts, though the\naccuracy for K-means in the Professor prompt for T5-FLAN-XXL are clearly stronger than others.\nOverall, this shows that the unsupervised methods are sensitive to irrelevant aspects of a prompt—\nif these methods were detecting knowledge/truth, it shouldn’t matter whether we give instructions to\ninterpret things literally.\n4.5. Agreement between unsupervised methods\nBurns et al. (2023) claim that knowledge has special structure that few other features in an LLM are\nlikely to satisfy and use this to motivate CCS. CCS aims to take advantage of this consistency structure,\nwhile PCA ignores it entirely. Nevertheless, we find that CCS and PCA5 make similar predictions. We\ncalculate the proportion of datapoints where both methods agree, shown in Figure 6 as a heatmap\naccording to their agreement. There is higher agreement (top-line number) in all cases than what\none would expect from independent methods (notated “Ind:”) with the observed accuracies (shown\nin parentheses in the heatmap). This supports the hypothesis of Emmons (2023) and suggests that\nthe consistency-condition does not do much. But the fact that two methods with such different\nmotivations behave similarly also supports the idea that results on current unsupervised methods\nmay be predictive of future methods which have different motivations.\n5. Related Work\nWe want to detect when an LLM is dishonest (Askell et al., 2021; Kenton et al., 2021; Park et al.,\n2023), outputting text which contradicts its encoded knowledge (Evans et al., 2021).

Annotations in each cell show\nthe agreement, the expected agreement for independent methods, and the (CCS, PCA) accuracies,\naveraged across 10 CCS seeds.\npart of this is to elicit latent knowledge from a model (Christiano et al., 2021). There has been some\ndebate as to whether LLMs “know/believe” anything (Bender et al., 2021; Levinstein and Herrmann,\n2023; Shanahan, 2022) but, for us, the important thing is that something in an LLM’s weights causes\nit to make consistently successful predictions, and we would like to access that. Others (see (Hase\net al., 2023) and references therein) aim to detect when a model has knowledge/beliefs about the\nworld, to improve truthfulness.\nDiscovering latent information in trained neural networks using unsupervised learning has been\nexplored by Dalvi et al. (2022) using clustering to discover latent concepts in BERT (Devlin et al.,\n2018) and also explored by Belrose et al. (2023) to train unsupervised probes on intermediate LLM\nlayers to elicit latent predictions.\nContrast-consistent search (CCS) (Burns et al., 2023) is a method which attempts to elicit latent\nknowledge using unsupervised learning on contrastive LLM activations (see Section 2), claiming that\nknowledge has special structure that can be used as an objective function which, when optimised,\nwill discover latent knowledge.\nWe have refuted this claim, theoretically and empirically, showing that CCS performs similarly to\nother unsupervised methods which do not use special structure of knowledge. Emmons (2023) also\nobserve this from the empirical data provided in (Burns et al., 2023). Huben (2022) hypothesises\nthere could be many truth-like features, due to LLMs ability to role-play (Shanahan et al., 2023),\nwhich a method like CCS might find. Roger (2023) constructs multiple different probes achieving low\nCCS loss and high accuracy, showing that there is more than one knowledge-like classifier. Levinstein\nand Herrmann (2023) finds that CCS sometimes learns features that are uncorrelated with truth, and\nargue that consistency properties of knowledge alone cannot guarantee identification of truth. Fry\net al. (2023) modify the CCS to improve accuracy despite probes clustering around 0.5, casting doubt\non the probabilistic interpretation of CCS probes. In contrast to all these works, we prove theoretically\nthat CCS does not optimise for knowledge, and show empirically what features CCS can instead find\nother than knowledge in controlled experiments.\nOur focus in this paper has been on unsupervised learning, though several other methods to train\nprobes to discover latent knowledge use supervised learning (Azaria and Mitchell, 2023; Li et al.,\n2023; Marks and Tegmark, 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023) – see also Clymer et al. (2023)\nfor a comparison of the generalisation properties of some of these methods under distribution shifts.\nFollowing Burns et al. (2023) we also reported results using a supervised logistic regression baseline,\n11\nChallenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery\nwhich we have found to work well on all our experiments, and which is simpler than in those cited\nworks.\nOur result is analogous to the finding that disentangled representations seemingly cannot be\nidentified without supervision (Locatello et al., 2019). Though not the focus of our paper, supervised\nmethods face practical and conceptual problems for eliciting latent knowledge. Conceptual in that\nestablishing ground-truth supervision about what the model knows (as opposed to what we know or\nthink it knows) is not currently a well-defined procedure. Practical in that ground-truth supervision\nfor superhuman systems that know things we do not is especially difficult.\nThere are also attempts to detect dishonesty by supervised learning on LLM outputs under\nconditions that produce honest or dishonest generations (Pacchiardi et al., 2023). We do not compare\ndirectly to this, focusing instead on methods that search for features in activation-space.\n6. Discussion and Conclusion\nLimitation: generalizability to future methods.\nOur experiments can only focus on current\nmethods. Perhaps future unsupervised methods could leverage additional structure beyond negation-\nconsistency, and so truly identify the model’s knowledge? While we expect that such methods could\navoid the most trivial distractors like banana/shed (Figure 2), we speculate that they will nonetheless\nbe vulnerable to similar critiques. The main reason is that we expect powerful models to be able\nto simulate the beliefs of other agents (Shanahan et al., 2023). Since features that represent agent\nbeliefs will naturally satisfy consistency properties of knowledge, methods that add new consistency\nproperties could still learn to detect such features rather than the model’s own knowledge. Indeed, in\nFigures 3 and 4, we show that existing methods produce probes that report the opinion of a simulated\ncharacter.6\nAnother response could be to acknowledge that there will be some such features, but they will\nbe few in number, and so you can enumerate them and identify the one that represents the model’s\nknowledge (Burns, 2022). Conceptually, we disagree: language models can represent many fea-\ntures (Elhage et al., 2022), and it seems likely that features representing the beliefs of other agents\nwould be quite useful to language models. For example, for predicting text on the Internet, it is\nuseful to have features that represent the beliefs of different political groups, different superstitions,\ndifferent cultures, various famous people, and more.\nConclusion.\nExisting unsupervised methods are insufficient for discovering latent knowledge, though\nconstructing contrastive activations may still serve as a useful interpretability tool. We contribute\nsanity checks for evaluating methods using modified prompts and metrics for features which are not\nknowledge. Unsupervised approaches have to overcome the identification issues we outline in this\npaper, whilst supervised approaches have the problem of requiring accurate human labels even in the\ncase of superhuman models. The relative difficulty of each remains unclear. We think future work\nproviding empirical testbeds for eliciting latent knowledge will be valuable in this regard.\n6Note that we do not know whether the feature we extract tracks the beliefs of the simulated character: there are clear\nalternative hypotheses that explain our results. For example in Figure 3, while one hypothesis is that the feature is tracking\nAlice’s opinion, another hypothesis that is equally compatible with our results is that the feature simply identifies whether\nthe two instances of “positive” / “negative” are identical or different.\n12\nChallenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery\n7.

Proof of Theorem 1\nWe’ll first consider the proof of Thm. 1.\nTheorem 1. Let feature ℎ: 𝑄→{0, 1}, be any arbitrary map from questions to binary outcomes. Let\n(𝑥+\n𝑖, 𝑥−\n𝑖) be the contrast pair corresponding to question 𝑞𝑖. Then the probe defined as 𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖) = ℎ(𝑞𝑖),\nand with 𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖) = 1 −ℎ(𝑞𝑖), achieves optimal loss, and the averaged prediction satisfies ˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) =\n\u0002\n𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖) + (1 −𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖))\n\u0003\n/2 = ℎ(𝑞𝑖).\nProof. We’ll show each term of LCCS is zero:\nLcons =\n\u0002\n𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖) −(1 −𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖))\n\u00032 = [ℎ(𝑞𝑖) −[1 −{1 −ℎ(𝑞𝑖)}]]2 = 0\nLconf = min\n\b\n𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖), 𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖)\n\t2 = min {ℎ(𝑞𝑖), 1 −ℎ(𝑞𝑖)}2 = 0\nwhere on the second line we’ve used the property that ℎ(𝑞𝑖) is binary. So the overall loss is zero\n(which is optimal). Finally, the averaged probe is\n˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) = 1\n2\n\u0002\n𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖) + (1 −𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖))\n\u0003\n= 1\n2\nh\nℎ(𝑞𝑖) + [1 −{1 −ℎ(𝑞𝑖)}]\ni\n= ℎ(𝑞𝑖).\n□\nA.2. Symmetry correction for CCS Loss\nDue to a quirk in the formulation of CCS, Lconf only checks for confidence by searching for probe\noutputs near 0, while ignoring probe outputs near 1. This leads to an overall downwards bias: for\nexample, if the probe must output a constant, that is 𝑝(𝑥) = 𝑘for some constant 𝑘, then the CCS\nloss is minimized when 𝑘= 0.4 (Roger, 2023, footnote 3), instead of being symmetric around 0.5.\nBut there is no particular reason that we would want a downward bias. We can instead modify the\nconfidence loss to make it symmetric:\nLsym\nconf = min\n\b\n𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖), 𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖), 1 −𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖), 1 −𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖)\n\t2\n(1)\nThis then eliminates the downwards bias: for example, if the probe must output a constant, the\nsymmetric CCS loss is minimized at 𝑘= 0.4 and 𝑘= 0.6, which is symmetric around 0.5. In the\nfollowing theorem (and all our experiments) we use this symmetric form of the CCS loss.\nA.3. Proof of Theorem 2\nWe’ll now consider Thm. 2, using the symmetric CCS loss. To prove Thm. 2 we’ll first need a lemma.\nLemma 1. Let 𝑝be a probe, which has an induced classifier 𝑓𝑝(𝑞𝑖) = I [˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) > 0.5], for averaged\nprediction ˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) = 1\n2\n\u0002\n𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖) + (1 −𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖))\n\u0003. Let ℎ: 𝑄→{0, 1}, be an arbitrary map from questions to\nbinary outputs. Define 𝑝′(𝑥+/−\n𝑖\n) = 𝑝(𝑥+/−\n𝑖\n) ⊕ℎ(𝑞𝑖). Then LCCS(𝑝′) = LCCS(𝑝) and 𝑝′ has the induced\nclassifier 𝑓𝑝′(𝑞𝑖) = 𝑓𝑝(𝑞𝑖) ⊕ℎ(𝑞𝑖).\n16\nChallenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery\nProof.

Next, the symmetric confidence loss.\nLsym\nconf(𝑝′) = min\n\b\n𝑝′(𝑥+\n𝑖), 𝑝′(𝑥−\n𝑖), 1 −𝑝′(𝑥+\n𝑖), 1 −𝑝′(𝑥−\n𝑖)\n\t2\n= min\n\b\n𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖) ⊕ℎ(𝑞𝑖), 𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖) ⊕ℎ(𝑞𝑖), 1 −𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖) ⊕ℎ(𝑞𝑖), 1 −𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖) ⊕ℎ(𝑞𝑖)\n\t2\nCase ℎ(𝑞𝑖) = 0 follows simply:\n= min\n\b\n𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖), 𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖), 1 −𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖), 1 −𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖)\n\t2\n= Lsym\nconf(𝑝)\nCase ℎ(𝑞𝑖) = 1:\n= min\n\b\n1 −𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖), 1 −𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖), 𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖), 𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖)\n\t2\n= Lsym\nconf(𝑝)\nSo the confidence loss is the same, and so the overall loss is the same.

Let 𝑔: 𝑄→{0, 1}, be any arbitrary map from questions to binary outputs. Let (𝑥+\n𝑖, 𝑥−\n𝑖)\nbe the contrast pair corresponding to question 𝑞𝑖. Let 𝑝be a probe, whose average result ˜𝑝=\n[𝑝(𝑥+\n𝑖)+(1−𝑝(𝑥−\n𝑖))]\n2\ninduces a classifier 𝑓𝑝(𝑞𝑖) = I [˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) > 0.5]. Define a transformed probe 𝑝′(𝑥+/−\n𝑖\n) =\n𝑝(𝑥+/−\n𝑖\n) ⊕\n\u0002\n𝑓𝑝(𝑞𝑖) ⊕𝑔(𝑞𝑖)\n\u0003. For all such transformed probes, LCCS(𝑝′) = LCCS(𝑝) and 𝑝′ induces the\narbitrary classifier 𝑓𝑝′(𝑞𝑖) = 𝑔(𝑞𝑖).\nProof. We begin with the loss. Note that ( 𝑓𝑝⊕𝑔)(𝑞𝑖) is binary, since 𝑓𝑝and 𝑔are binary, so we can\napply Lemma 1 with ℎ(𝑞𝑖) = ( 𝑓𝑝⊕𝑔)(𝑞𝑖), which leads to the result: LCCS(𝑝′) = LCCS(𝑝). Now the\ninduced classifier.\n𝑓𝑝′ = 𝑓𝑝⊕ℎ\nby Lemma 1\n= 𝑓𝑝⊕( 𝑓𝑝⊕𝑔)\n= 𝑔\nwhere the last line can be deduced via addition (mod 2), since 𝑓𝑝and 𝑔are binary and ⊕reduces to\nthe xor operator on binary inputs.\n□\nB.

Dataset details\nWe now give details on the process through which we generate the activation data. First we tokenize\nthe data according the usual specifications of each model (e.g. for T5 we use the T5 tokenizer, for\nChinchilla we use the Chinchilla tokeniser). We prepend with a BOS token, right-pad, and we don’t\nuse EOS token. We take the activation corresponding to the last token in a given layer – layer 30 for\nChinchilla unless otherwise stated, and the encoder output for T5 models. We use normalisation as in\nBurns et al. (2023), taking separate normalisation for each prompt template and using the average\nstandard deviation per dimension with division taken element-wise. We use a context length of 512\nand filter the data by removing the pair (𝑥+\n𝑖, 𝑥−\n𝑖) when the token length for either 𝑥+\n𝑖or 𝑥−\n𝑖exceeds this\ncontext length. Our tasks are multiple choice, and we balance our datasets to have equal numbers of\nthese binary labels, unless stated otherwise. For Chinchilla we harvest activations in bfloat16 format\nand then cast them to float32 for downstream usage. For T5 we harvest activations at float32.\nB.3. Method Training Details\nWe now give further details for the training of our various methods. Each method uses 50 random\nseeds.\nB.3.1. CCS\nWe use the symmetric version of the confidence loss, see Equation (1). We use a linear probe with 𝑚\nweights, 𝜃, and a single bias, 𝑏, where 𝑚is the dimension of the activation, followed by a sigmoid\nfunction. We use Haiku’s (Hennigan et al., 2020) default initializer for the linear layer: for 𝜃a\ntruncated normal with standard deviation 1/√𝑚, and 𝑏= 0. We use the following hyperparameters:\nwe train with full batch; for Chinchilla models we use a learning rate of 0.001, for T5 models, 0.01.\nWe use AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0. We train for 1000 epochs. We report results on all\nseeds as we are interested in the overall robustness of the methods (note the difference to Burns et al.\n(2023) which only report seed with lowest CCS loss).\nB.3.2. PCA\nWe use the Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) implementation of PCA, with 3 components, and the\nrandomized SVD solver. We take the classifier to be based around whether the projected datapoint\nhas top component greater than zero. For input data we take the difference between contrast pair\nactivations.\nB.3.3. K-means\nWe use the Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) implementation of K-means, with two clusters and\nrandom initialiser. For input data we take the difference between contrast pair activations.\nB.3.4. Random\nThis follows the CCS method setup above, but doesn’t do any training, just evaluates using a probe\nwith randomly initialised parameters (as initialised in the CCS method).\nB.3.5. Logistic Regression\nWe use the Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) implementation of Logistic Regression, with liblinear\nsolver and using a different random shuffling of the data based on random seed. For input data we\n24\nChallenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery\nconcatenate the contrast pair activations. We report training accuracy.\nC. Further Results\nC.1.

For Chinchilla-70B BoolQ and DBPedia see Figure 7 (for IMDb see\nFigure 2). We see that BoolQ follows a roughly similar pattern to IMDb, except that the default ground\ntruth accuracy is not high (BoolQ is arguably a more challenging task). DBpedia shows more of a\nnoisy pattern which is best explained by first inspecting the PCA visualisation for the modified prompt\n(right): there are groupings into both choice 1 true/false (blue orange) which is more prominent and\nsits along the top principal component (x-axis), and also a grouping into banana/shed (dark/light),\nalong second component (y-axis). This is reflected in the PCA and K-means performance here doing\nwell on ground-truth accuracy. CCS is similar, but more bimodal, sometimes finding the ground-truth,\nand sometimes the banana/shed feature.\nFor T5-11B (Figure 8) on IMDB and BoolQ we see a similar pattern of results to Chinchilla, though\nwith lower accuracies. On DBpedia, all of the results are around random chance, though logistic\nregression is able to solve the task, meaning this information is linearly encoded but perhaps not\n25\nChallenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery\nsalient enough for the unsupervised methods to pick up.\nT5-FLAN-XXL (Figure 9) shows more resistance to our modified prompt, suggesting fine-tuning\nhardens the activations in such a way that unsupervised learning can still recover knowledge. For CCS\nthough in particular, we do see a bimodal distribution, sometimes learning the banana/shed feature.\nC.2. Discovering an explicit opinion\nC.2.1. Other models and datasets\nHere we display results for the experiments on discovering an explicit opinion using datasets IMDB,\nBoolQ and DBpedia, and models Chinchilla-70B (Figure 10), T5-11B (Figure 11) and T5-FLAN-XXL\n(Figure 12). For Chinchilla-70B and T5 we use just a single mention of Alice’s view, and for T5-\nFLAN-XXL we use five, since for a single mention the effect is not strong enough to see the effect,\nperhaps due to instruction-tuning of T5-FLAN-XXL. The next appendix Appendix C.2.2 ablates the\nnumber of mentions of Alice’s view. Overall we see a similar pattern in all models and datasets, with\nunsupervised methods most often finding Alice’s view, though for T5-FLAN-XXL the CCS results are\nmore bimodal in the modified prompt case.\nC.2.2. Number of Repetitions\nIn this appendix we present an ablation on the discovering explicit opinion experiment from Sec-\ntion Section 4.2. We vary the number of times the speaker repeats their opinion from 0 to 7 (see\nAppendix B.1 Explicit opinion variants), and in Figure 13 plot the accuracy in the method predicting\nthe speaker’s view. We see that for Chinchilla and T5, only one repetition is enough for the method to\ntrack the speaker’s opinion. T5-FLAN-XXL requires more repetitions, but eventually shows the same\npattern. We suspect that the instruction-tuning of T5-FLAN-XXL is responsible for making this model\nsomewhat more robust.\nC.2.3. Model layer\nWe now look at whether the layer, in the Chinchilla70B model, affects our results. We consider both\nthe ground-truth accuracy on default setting, Figure 14, and Alice Accuracy under the modified\nsetting (with one mention of Alice’s view), Figure 15. Overall, we find our results are not that sensitive\nto layer, though often layer 30 is a good choice for both standard and sycophantic templates. In the\nmain paper we always use layer 30. In the default setting, Figure 14, we see overall k-means and PCA\nare better or the same as CCS. This is further evidence that the success of unsupervised learning on\ncontrastive activations has little to do with the consitency structure of CCS. In modified setting, we\nsee all layers suffer the same issue of predicting Alice’s view, rather than the desired accuracy.\nC.3. Discovering an implicit opinion\nIn this appendix we display further results for Section 4.3 on discovering an implicit opinion. Figure 16\ndisplays the results on the T5-11B (top) and T5-FLAN-XXL (bottom) models. For T5-11B we see CCS,\nunder both default and modified prompts, performs at about 60% on non-company questions, and\nmuch better on company questions. The interpretation is that this probe has mostly learnt to classify\nwhether a topic is company or not (but not to distinguish between the other thirteen categories). PCA\nand K-means are similar, though with less variation amongst seeds (showing less bimodal behaviour).\nPCA visualisation doesn’t show any natural groupings.\nFor T5-FLAN-XXL the accuracies are high on both default and modified prompts for both company\n26\nChallenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery\nand non-company questions. We suspect that a similar trick as in the case of explicit opinion, repeating\nthe opinion, may work here, but we leave investigation of this to future work. PCA visualisation shows\nsome natural groups, with the top principal component showing a grouping based on whether choice\n1 is true or false (blue/orange), but also that there is a second grouping based on company/non-\ncompany (dark/light). This suggests it is more luck that the most prominent direction here is choice\n1 is true or false, but could easily have been company/non-company (dark/light).\nC.4. Prompt Template Sensitivity – Other Models\nIn Figure 17 we show results for the prompt sensitivity experiments on the truthfulQA dataset, for\nthe other models T5-FLAN-XXL (top) and T5-11B (bottom). We see similar results as in the main text\nfor Chinchilla70B. For T5 all of the accuracies are lower, mostly just performing at chance, and the\nPCA plots don’t show natural groupings by true/false.\nC.5. Number of Prompt templates\nIn the main experiments for this paper we use a single prompt template for simplicity and to isolate\nthe differences between the default and modified prompt template settings. We also investigated the\neffect of having multiple prompt templates, as in (Burns et al., 2023), see Figure 18. Overall we don’t\nsee a major effect. On BoolQ we see a single template is slightly worse for Chinchilla70B and T5, but\nthe same for T5-FLAN-XXL. For IMDB on Chinchilla a single template is slightly better than multiple,\nwith less variation across seeds. For DBPedia on T5, a single template is slightly better. Other results\nare roughly the same.\n27\nChallenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery\nPrompt template\nDefault\nBanana/Shed\nAccuracy \nbasis\n Ground truth\n Banana/Shed\nCCS\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nAccuracy\nPCA\nK-Means\nRandom\nLog.
