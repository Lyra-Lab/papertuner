Our algorithm, akin to an unsupervised variant of linear regression,\nmaximizes the Sharpe Ratio of PnL generated from signals constructed linearly from exogenous\nvariables.\nThe methodology employs a linear relationship between exogenous variables and the trading sig-\nnal, with the objective of maximizing the Sharpe Ratio through parameter optimization.

Our initial objective was to find a simple unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithm\ncapable of exploiting a set of exogenous variables to produce a PnL-effective signal. We observed that\nthe literature in quantitative finance largely favors supervised ML approaches, aiming to predict specific\nfinancial magnitudes, such as asset prices, as highlighted in the works of Johnson (2023) [1], Rouf et al.\n[2], Soni et al. (2022) [3], and Kumar et al. (2022) [4].\nThere are also unsupervised techniques, as presented by Kelly and Xiu (2023) [5], and Hoang and\nWiegratz (2023) [6]. However, these methods are very specific and lack the versatility to be used as\ngeneral tools, specifically for small dataset. An exception in this category is the generation of signals via\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA), as explained by Ghorbani and Chong (2020) [7]. Nevertheless,\nthis technique offers little flexibility and does not allow for the explicit optimization of specific criteria\nwithin the PnL.\nWe therefore turned our attention to the literature on optimization in finance, with studies such as\nthose by Jurczenko et al. (2019) [8], Huang et al. (2019) [9], and Cornu´ejols et al. (2017, 2018) [10] [11],\nReppen et al. (2022) [12], primarily focusing on portfolio optimization. However, these works are more\nconcerned with optimizing portfolios than signal creation.\nAs a result, we decided to construct our own algorithm, developing an unsupervised counterpart to\nlinear regression aimed at optimizing the Sharpe Ratio of a PnL. The model is based on two hypotheses\nof linearity: the linearity of the relationship between the exogenous variables and the signal; and the\nlinearity of the relationship between the PnL and the signal. Using these, we can deduce a parametric\nrepresentation of the PnL. We sought to optimize these parameters to maximize the Sharpe Ratio of the\nobtained PnL.\nThe optimal parameters are calculated over a certain training period and are then used to generate\nthe signal subsequently. Other techniques, mainly regularization and correction of this signal, are then\naddressed and ultimately enable the creation of a very effective strategy on a backtest of about twenty\nyears.\n1\narXiv:2401.05337v1  [q-fin.ST]  22 Nov 2023\nExecutive Summary\n• We consider an asset with a specific price series pricet and a set of stationary and homoscedastic\nvariables X1,t, X2,t, . . . , Xn,t.\n• The objective is to derive the ’optimal’ linear signal extracted from this variable. We work\nunder two linear assumptions:\n– We will consider the signal as a linear combination of the exogenous variables:\nsignalt = α0 + α1X1,t + α2X2,t + . . . + αnXn,t\n– At each time step t, the positions taken is proportional to both the signal and the price\npost = pricet × signalt (a negative value would correspond to a short position). This\napproach establishes a linear relationship between Profit and Loss (PnL) and the trading\nsignal. We get, after computation:\nPnLt = signalt−1 × (pricet −pricet−1)\nThis allows us to express PnL as a linear combination of the variables:\nPnLt = αT[Xt−1 × (pricet −pricet−1)]\n• A parametric expression of the empiric Sharpe Ratio is then derived:\nL(α) :=\nPnL\nσ(PnL) =\nαTµ\n√\nαTΣα\nWith µi and Σi,j the empiric mean and covariance of the variables (Xi,t−1×(pricet−pricet−1))i\nThe optimality criterion is to maximize this empirical Sharpe Ratio. Transforming this into\nan optimization problem, the alpha that maximizes the objective function L(α) is:\nˆα =\nΣ-1µ\np\nµTΣ-1µ\nThese optimal coefficients, upon examination, are seen to create a signal with the highest\ncorrelation to the asset’s price variations, constrained by a low variance in this correlation.\nThe constraint’s trade-off is mecanically set to maximize the sharpe ratio.\n• This model can then be utilized as an unsupervised Machine Learning model for finance\nstrategies: trained on a dataset composed of the price and exogenous variables of the last τ\ndays (t −τ, ..., t −1), and used to create the present-time signal at t.\nAdditional engineering techniques, mainly feature engineering of the exogenous variables, spe-\ncific regularization techniques, and a corrective factor, are employed to develop and enhance\nthe quantitative finance strategies based on this model.\n• This model was tested to create a buy/sell strategy on a specific asset (’IEF’, a widely traded\nExchange Traded Fund (ETF) that mirrors the performance of U.S. Treasury bonds with\nmaturities of 1-3 years). The strategy yielded qualitative results, exhibiting good metrics in\nterms of risk-adjusted return: an effective Sharpe ratio of 1.2 when backtested over the period\n2000-2023.\nHowever, a high turnover mitigates the quality of this specific strategy, indicating a need for\nfurther improvements.\n2\n1\nProblem Formulation\nConsider an asset whose price evolves according to the time series (pricet)t. An investment strategy for\nthis asset entails the creation of a time series (post)t, contingent on time, representing a position on\nthis asset, i.e., the number of shares purchased of this asset multiplied by its price. Once a position\npost is determined, it is straightforward to compute the PnL: indeed, we have a asset value’s variation\nterm (post −post−1) which corresponds to the value variation of the positions and a cashflow term:\npricet × (\npost−1\npricet−1 −\npost\npricet ) which corresponds to encashing (resp. disbursing) the value difference of the\npositions sold (resp. bought) during the period.\nHence, the sum of these two terms is: PnLt = post−1\npricet −pricet−1\npricet−1\nSubsequently, this time series post is primarily determined by constructing a principal signal in the\nform of a time series signalt. Thus, in the general case, post = ft(pricet, signalt). It then becomes essential\nto ascertain both ft and signalt to optimize the PnL. This signal can be constructed in numerous ways,\neither technically or by utilizing fine economic relations between the asset price and certain exogenous\nvariables. In our case, we will focus on the creation of a signal with a position-taking form as follow :\npost = pricet × signalt\n(H1)\nwhich corresponds to the case where one decides to hold exactly signalt shares of the asset at any time t.\nTherefore we can deduce the relation between PnLt, pricet and signalt :\nPnLt = signalt−1 × (pricet −pricet−1)\nNow let’s consider a set of stationary and homoscedastic variables denoted as X1,t, X2,t, . . . , Xn,t and\ncreate a signal as a linear combination of these variables. The sought-after signal is:\nsignalt = α0 + α1X1,t + α2X2,t + . . . + αnXn,t\n(H2)\nThat we will note with matrix notation: signalt = αTXt with: X0,t = 1 for the intercept\nMultiplying equation (H2) by (pricet −pricet−1) and then substituting relation between PnLt, pricet and\nsignalt, into yields:\nPnLt = αT ˜Xt where ˜Xi,t = (pricet −pricet−1)Xi,t−1\nNow that a parametric expression for our PnL has been established, our goal is to define a metric for\noptimizing our PnL. The Sharpe Ratio, acts as a gauge for evaluating the risk-adjusted performance of a\ntrading strategy. It is computed as the mean return of the strategy minus the risk-free rate (in practice\nin quant finance, and in this paper, the risk-free rate is set to 0), divided by the standard deviation\nof the return, thus rendering a normalization for volatility.\nThis ratio is usefull as it elucidates the\nreturn potential but also encapsulates the inherent risk, thereby offering a comprehensive measure of a\nstrategy’s efficacy and robustness.\nThe objective function we aim to maximize is thus defined as the Sharpe Ratio of the PnL, computed\nover the expectancy and standard deviation:\nL := E[PnL]\nσ[PnL]\n2\nMathematical Analysis and Optimization\nUsing the notations µT =\nh\n˜X0,t,\n˜X1,t,\n. . . ,\n˜Xn,t\ni\nand Σ =\n\u0002\ncov( ˜Xi,t, ˜Xj,t)i,j\n\u0003\nfor the empiric mean\nvector and covariance matrix of ˜Xt, we have:\nPnL = αTµ and σemp.(PnL) =\n√\nαTΣα\n3\nThus, we can compute the objective function as the empiric sharpe ratio:\nL(α) =\nαTµ\n√\nαTΣα\nFor an invertible Σ, the closed-form solution for the α that maximize L is1:\nˆα =\nΣ-1µ\np\nµTΣ-1µ\nFinally the Optimal Linear Signal extracted from the exogenous variables can be computed by: ˆαTXt\nHow to Interpret These Results?\nA ’good signal’ is defined as a time series signalt whose 1-day lagged series signalt−1 exhibits a high\ncorrelation with the asset’s price variation (pricet −pricet−1). The methodology we present aims to\nconstruct a linear signal that maximally captures the most of this correlation using n exogenous\nvariables, under the constraint of a low variation of this correlation.\nIn effect, µi are estimator of E[(pricet −pricet−1) × Xi,t], and actually represents the empirical\ncovariance between the series (Xi,t−1)t and the price variations (pricet −pricet−1). The corrective\nterm involving Σ-1 is introduced to reduce the variance of the PnL generated by this method.\nThe trade-off is mecanically set to maximize the sharpe ratio.\nRemarks:\n• The presence of non-stationarity in the Xt variable introduces bias, predominantly captured by\nthe intercept term α0. Essentially, the mean contribution of each variable influences the intercept,\npotentially assigning it an irrelevant value that fails to capture information effectively.\n• Heteroscedasticity can introduce bias in the model. This phenomenon occurs because variables\nwith larger amplitude variations are perceived by the model as being more significant compared\nto others. Such disproportionate emphasis on certain variables due to their variance can skew the\nmodel’s performance, leading to biased outcomes.\nThen, a good practice is to standardize the exogenous variables Xt before using them in the model, it\nforces them into stationnarity and homoscedasticity, at the conditio, that the mean and variance does\nnot change too fast – i.e. the magnitude of changes is low on a timescale of ’training size’.\n2.1\nAchieving beta neutrality\nA limitation of this optimizatio problem is that it is not inherently beta neutral. The signal might cor-\nrelate with the asset’s price or, by extension, the market. However, at the expense of some performance,\nit is feasible to introduce a constraint to decorrelate the signal from the asset’s price.\nIncorporating the constraint αTβ = 0 into the optimization problem alters the vector µ to\n˜µ = µ −µTΣ-1β\nβTΣ-1β β\nand then use this altered µ in the optimal beta formula given in section 2.\nBy setting β = pricet × Xt, the average of the product of Xt and pricet, we generate a signal un-\ncorrelated with the asset’s price, achieving a form of beta neutrality. We can also choose any yt and\nβ = yt × Xt in order to get a signal uncorrelated to yt.\n1We can compute the gradient of L which is null when Σα ∝µ:\n∇L(α) = µ(αTΣα) −Σα\n(αTΣα)3/2\nThe coefficient of proportionnarity is free since L(|cst| × α) = L(α) we have choosen a positive one that gives: αTΣα = 1\nfor a unitary standard deviation of the PnL and a positive expectancy.\n4\n2.2\nRegularization techniques\nL1 regularization:\nWhen confronting potential redundancy among exogenous variables, L1 regular-\nization emerges as a viable solution. It modifies the objective function to:\n˜L(α) = L(α) −λ1|α|\nthereby promoting sparsity in the parameter vector α. No closed-form solution is available in this case,\nnecessitating numerical optimization to find: ˆα = argmax ˜L. To maintain parameter comparability and\ninterpretability an alternative formulation can be considered:\n˜L(α) = L(α) −(λ1 × max L) × |α|\nL2 regularization:\nFor non-invertible covariance matrix Σ, L2 regularization can be utilized to ensure\ninvertibility by adding a scaled identity matrix, resulting in:\n˜Σ = Σ + λ2Id\nHowever, to preserve parameter comparability and interpretability, an alternative transformation can be\nemployed:\n˜Σ = (Σ + λ2\n||Σ||\nn Id)\n(1 + λ2)\nPCA regularization:\nAnother approach involves the use of PCA (Principal Component Analysis)\nbefore calculating µ and Σ, in order to select only the top k principal components of ˜Xt. Caution is\nrequired: the PCA should be performed on ˜Xt rather than Xt. This is because the valuable information\nresides in the covariance of the transformed variables ˜Xi,t = (pricet−pricet−1)Xi,t−1, not in the covariance\nof the original variables. Therefore, conducting PCA within the OLS model is preferable rather than\nprior to it.\nDenoting µi and σi, the empiric mean and standard deviation of the ith principal component. Since\nthe principals components are uncorrellated, Σ is diagonal and ˆα is computed with :\nˆαi = µi\nσ2\ni\n/\nv\nu\nu\nt\nk\nX\nj=1\nµ2\nj\nσ2\nj\nThe signal regularized is: ˆαTΠXt with Π the (k × n + 1) matrix of the projector onto the top k principal\ncomponents of ˜Xt. Note that Π is the projector onto the top k principal components of ˜Xt, not of Xt.\nStatistical Significance Regularization:\nFor each alpha coefficient, we compute the p-value of αi\nand retain only those coefficients ˆαi that meet the criterion:\nP[αi = 0|ˆαi] < pthreshold\nThe p-value is computed assuming that ˜\nXt adheres to a Gaussian distribution. Under null hypothesis\nsubsequent calculations2 reveal that √τ ˆαi × ˆαTµ follows a Student’s t-distribution with τ −1 degrees of\nfreedom, where τ denotes the length of the time series. This understanding enables the computation of\nthe aforementioned p-value.\nPractical use of the ML model\nIn practical terms, this model is applicable in the development of a trading strategy. This process\nentails the training of the model over a span of τ days, utilizing datasets (Xt−τ, ..., Xt−1) and\n(pricet−τ, ..., pricet−1). From this training dataset, ˆα is deduced through the prescribed methodology.\nThen, a signal for the subsequent day, t, is formulated as ˆαTXt.\nThis results in a machine learning model able to at generate linear trading signals from exogenous\nvariables. The model is parametric, encompassing parameters such as the training period τ, and a\nregularization parameter for each regularization technique.\n2The demonstration is straightforward in the case where Σ is diagonal because we have : √τ ˆαi × ˆαTµ = √τ µi\nσi .\n5\nRemark on overfitting:\nWith at most an order of magnitude of 5000 data points, the available\ndataset is quite limited, inherently posing a constant risk of overfitting. The key to the success of such\na machine learning model lies in its ability to effectively implement regularization. This is the rationale\nbehind proposing a variety of complementary regularization methods in the previous section. Beyond\nfeature engineering, a significant portion of the empirical work presented in the next part has been\ndedicated to constructing and optimizing relevant regularization techniques to mitigate this issue. Still,\nthis problem should be kept in mind as a important risk using this model for a real trading strategy.\n3\nEmpirical Application to a Trading Strategy\nThe strategies empirically tested in this document is a day-to-day strategies. We consider an asset with\nan opening price denoted by pricet, reflecting the Open price of the asset in the market. A signal signalt\nis generated using the proposed method. At the market opening we buy3, signalt shares of the asset,\nunder the condition that the signal is sufficient, establishing a position of:\npost = signalt × pricet if: Zscore(signalt) > 1 else: 0\nTraded Products: ’IEF’, a widely traded Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that mirrors the perfor-\nmance of U.S. Treasury bonds of maturities: 1-3 years.\nExogenous variables: Prices of U.S. treasury bonds of differing maturities and various macros,\nthat have been feature-engineered.\nData: Open source data from Yahoo finance.\nThe graph below corroborates the signal’s efficacy: intervals of augmented signals (illustrated in red)\nare congruent with noticeable ascents in the PnL.\nQuantitative Metrics: Sharpe Ratio: 1.25 / effective4: 2.1 ;\nTurnover: 45.9%; Bips: 18.9\nHowever, it is observed that over a longer period, we are subject to fluctuations: at times, the signal\nmisinterprets the direction. The primary reason is that the signal can detect that the period is conducive\nto generating PnL, but it remains highly uncertain about which direction to take. Consequently, during\neach of these periods, the signal can choose the wrong direction, leading to frequent monetary losses in\nthe strategy, which adversely affects the metrics. As a result, we obtain rather mediocre outcomes, as\nshown in the following figure.\n3Note: The strategy operates under the assumption that: (i) the asset can be acquired at its opening price on day t,\n(ii) without any transaction fees, and that (iii) the action of the strategy will not have any effects on the market price.\n4Effective metrics are computed over the days where and effective trading has been made i.e. at days t where post ̸= 0\n6\nQuantitative Metrics: Sharpe Ratio: 0.09 / effective: 0.46 ;\nNevertheless, as depicted in the graph below, two corrective techniques have been identified that\ndrastically improve the results:\n• the introduction of a corrective factor, represented as ‘signalt = sg(PnLt)∗ˆαTXt’ (if the uncorrected\nmodel would have lost money on the previous day, the signal is reversed.) and,\n• the intensive application of statistical significance regularization,\nQuantitative Metrics: Sharpe Ratio: 0.55 / effective: 1.19 ;\nTurnover: 37.3% / effective: 184.1% ; Bips: 11.9 / effective: 51.1\nTo verify the functionality of our strategy beyond a specific set of parameters and to identify the\noptimal range of parameters yielding the best possible results, we conducted a comprehensive analysis\nby calculating the Sharpe Ratio of the PnL for various training sizes. This exercise is crucial to ensure\nthat the strategy was not just effective for a particular set of parameters (overfitting) but also adaptable\nand robust across different scenarios.\n7\nSharpe and effective sharpe ratio for different training sizes\nCaveat:\nthis strategy is good in terms of Sharpe ratio. Yet, when we look at the effective turnover,\nwe realize that these strategies perform poorly from this indicator’s perspective (effective turnover is\nmore than 150%.) Indeed, when plotting the PnL curve versus the curve of positions taken, it becomes\napparent that the strategy requires taking large positions to generate significant PnL.\nIn this specific scenario, to generate a cumulative PnL of 5 million USD, there are brief periods where\nan investment of up to 35 million USD is required. This observation underscores the strategy’s demand\nfor significant capital deployment at sporadic intervals to achieve the desired returns.\nNevertheless, given the high degree of certainty in these strategies (a Sharpe ratio of 1 implies that\nmoney is lost in less than 7% of cases), it becomes feasible to obtain such investments through leverage.\nThis approach allows for maximizing potential returns while managing the risk associated with significant\ncapital deployment. Thus, the described strategy either demands substantial sporadic investments, via\nleverage effect, or it needs to be refined through other quantitative finance methods to reduce this\nturnover.\n8\nConclusion\nThis study delineates a comprehensive framework for systematically constructing and optimizing trading\nstrategies, anchored in a solid mathematical approach. The core innovation resides in the formulation\nof a signal linearly derived from selected exogenous variables. By integrating a linear combination of\nthese variables into a strategic position-taking model, we have demonstrated a method that effectively\nconstructs a signal responsive to market dynamics and predictive of future trends.\nThe methodology involved formulating the trading signal as a linear combination of a set of exogenous\nvariables, which was subsequently employed to ascertain the position in the asset. The consequent PnL\ncomputation, based on the asset’s price variations and the held positions over time, underscores the\nrobustness of the proposed framework. This was further validated through empirical application, using\npublicly accessible market data, to demonstrate the efficacy of the model in constructing a durable trading\nstrategy. Looking forward, the study opens avenues for further technological development, which include:\n• Implement a New Regularization Aimed at Limiting Position Size: This approach could\naddress the high-turnover issue observed in the empirical tests. By integrating a regularization\nmechanism that constraints the size of positions taken, the strategy can be fine-tuned to balance\nPnL generation against the risk of excessive capital allocation. It would result in a sharpe ratio /\nturnover trade-off. Such regularization would ensure that the strategy remains robust and efficient,\nwithout necessitating disproportionately large investments.\n• Adapting the Model for Long/Short Strategies: Beyond the projection method described in\nsubsection 2.1 to achieve beta neutrality, it is feasible to adapt the model for executing long/short\nstrategies. This requires considering a multi-layer model, where an initial signal is generated for\neach asset. Subsequently, one must weight the signals of each asset to maintain a balanced position\nsituation. An analogous algorithm can be employed to optimally select this weighting.\n• Generalized Time Steps: In the ’How to Interpret These Results’ section, we have shown that\nthis methods constructs a time series st such that its 1-day lagged series st−1 is strongly correlated\nwith the asset price variations (pricet −pricet−1). This concept can be extended to ts-days lagged\ntime series st−ts, by examining their correlation with (pricet −pricet−ts). The optimal ts intervals\ncould be determined using methods that study seasonality, such as Fourier analysis.\n• Generalized Linear Signal: Expanding the signal model to a more generalized form: signalt =\nfact.(αTXt), lead to a new expression for PnL. The samed process can be applied by optimizing\nthe objective function L(α) accordingly.\nSome activation function fact. such as a logit activation function inspired by Logistic Regression to\ncreate a signal that can take values in [0,1], and can be used as a mitigateur of other signals. This\ngeneralization can be explored with various activation functions used as hyperparameters.\n• Continuous Hyperparameter Selection: In order to mitigate the risk of an overfitting signal\non a hyperparameter set, we can implement a dynamic system for adjusting hyperparameters every\n’training-size’ days, based on the hyperparameters that maximized metrics in the previous period.\nNote that this bruteforce method will significantly increase the computational cost.\n• Enhance Corrective Terms with Command & Control Theory: A primary limitation of\nthis model is its relatively low reactivity, as it updates only every ’training-size’ days. An approach\ngrounded in command & control theory could significantly enhance the model’s responsiveness,\nenabling real-time adjustments. The ’corrective factor’ introduced in the ’Empirical Application to\na Trading Strategy’ section represents a rudimentary form of this adaptive correction. Investigating\nthe application of command and control theory, especially the use of Kalman filters, to refine the\nmodel’s corrective terms emerges as a promising avenue for development. Such an advancement\nwould not only add dynamism to the model but also improve its accuracy and adaptability in\nresponse to evolving market conditions.\n• Stacking Linear Signal: Inspired by the concept of stacking regressors used in machine learning,\nwe could create a new, stacked signal by utilizing the Optimal Linear Signal with already efficient\nsignals used as Exogenous Variables, potentially enhancing the signals’ strength.\nIn particular, by utilizing the ’Achieving Beta Neutrality’ section, one can derive a beta-neutral\nsignal from general signals.\n9\n• Boosting Method: The subsection ’Achieving Beta Neutrality’ develops a method to generate\na signal uncorrelated to a certain time series. If a signal is generated from n variables and a PnL\nis deduced from it, it is entirely possible to generate a new residual signal that is uncorrelated to\nthis previous PnL. The sum of these two signals should have been able to capture more relevant\ninformation from the variables, on the condition that some non-linearity has been introduced\nsomewhere, and sufficient regularization avoid overfitting.\nOn the same principle as Boosting in ML, by iterating each time on the residual signal (orthogonal\nto the previous one), it is conceivable to construct very powerful signals.\nIn essence, this study not only lays a foundation for traders and financial analysts seeking to augment\ntheir strategies through quantitative methods but also sets the stage for continuous innovation and\nadvancement in systematic trading strategies.\nReferences\n[1] Johnson, J.
