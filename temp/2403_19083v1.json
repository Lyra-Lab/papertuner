INTRODUCTION\nCancer being one of the most intimidating illnesses coupled\nwith its unpredictable nature and impact on lives has made it\none of the top priorities for research. It is the leading cause of\npremature death in 57 countries. Although 80% of countries\nhad plans for cancer research, the number of correctly financed\nand resource-allocated facilities in these countries is still at\nthe bare minimum [1]. Hence, it is crucial to develop the\nrole of AI in cancer treatment. This project aims to explore\nand analyze the potential of the combination of artificial\nintelligence models (deep learning and Bayesian network) to\nidentify the risks of developing cancer in individual patients.\nII. BACKGROUND\nComputer scientists have been attempting to transition the\nglobe into an artificially intelligent world during the era of\ntechnology. Increased research effort has been put into the\ndevelopment of artificial intelligence (AI). Related research\non arXiv has reported the number of Artificial Intelligence\narticles has increased roughly from 6000 to 35,000, almost\n7 times [2]. In the foreseeable future, AI is expected to\nbe used in many industrial fields to enhance work quality\nand efficiency. Medical researchers have also noticed the\ntrend and capabilities of AI and have begun to adopt it in\nmedical research. However, even though studies in different\nmedical fields have shown that AI technology is successful\nand effective, only a small portion of AI tools are being used\nin current medical procedures [3]. A new approach will be\ndiscussed below as another idea to use AI contributions in\nmedical research, specifically, cancer research.\nA. Deep Learning\nDeep learning (DL) is a type of predictive model in machine\nlearning applications. DL is a machine-learning approach to\nmaking predictions through processing data in multiple layers\nof neural networks. As shown in Fig. 1, the name of DL\ncomes from its structure of multiple layers and stages used\nfor processing input data and making predictions [4]. Using a\nRestricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), the input layer consists\nof the inputs and a bias, the purpose of this layer is to\nlet the model learn all the input features. Then each subse-\nquent layer is calculated by applying weights and activation\nfunction evaluations to the output of previous layers. [5]. A\nsample construction of a DL model consists of a learning\nrate, a forward propagation process to compute the error of\npredictions, a backward propagation to optimize the problem\nby computing gradients of the functions, and a stochastic\ngradient descent function to help reach an optimal minimum.\n[6] DL’s multi-layered characteristic allows it to process a\nsubstantial amount of input data, making it particularly useful\nin image processing. In the health industry, imaging is crucial\nin allowing health practitioners to visualize what is happening\nto a patient. As a result, DL has increased importance in\nhealth industries, assisting the process of analyzing medical\nimages [7]. Recently, a Deep Learning image processing\nmodel developed to detect Alzheimer’s disease is reported to\nbe accurate 99.7% of the time. [8].\nFig. 1. Structure of Deep Learning Model.\narXiv:2403.19083v1  [cs.LG]  28 Mar 2024\nB. Bayesian Network\nBayesian Network (BN) utilizes concepts from Bayes’ the-\norem, it updates the current hypothesis in the model based on\nnewly observed information. [9]. BN is a graph that consists\nof nodes for each feature. Dependent nodes are connected via\ndirected paths to indicate the relationship. This setup allows\nBN to predict data with uncertainty using predefined condi-\ntional probabilities. [10]. BN focuses on predicting data with\nuncertainty on conditional probabilities under prior beliefs. To\nconstruct a Bayesian Network, features can be classified as\nnodes with dependency links. Dependency links are arrows\ndirected from one node to another, indicating the first node\nis dependent on the second. In Fig. 2, “the classifier learns\nfrom training data the conditional probability of each attribute\nAi given the class label C, classification is then done by\napplying Bayes rule to compute the probability of C given\nthe particular instance of A1, · · · , An, and then predicting\nthe class with the highest posterior probability” [11]. The\nadvantage of BN’s ability to make accurate predictions with\nlimited data over traditional machine learning algorithms has\nbeen adopted by many health institutes for research in cardiac\nconditions, cancer, psychological disorders, and lung disorders\n[12].\nFig. 2. Sample Bayesian Network.\nIII. METHODOLOGIES\nThough both DL and BN models are applicable in medical\nindustries, they each have their limitations and drawbacks. DL\nhas solid abilities to classify a substantial amount of data\nincluding image classification, but does poorly in situations\nwith limited data and high uncertainty. On the other hand, BNs\nare great at predicting under uncertainty but not necessarily\nefficient when handling large datasets, which may lead to\ncreating an excessively massive graph. As a result, this article\naims to analyze the possibility of combining the two models\ninto one, aiming to maximize the profits while minimizing the\ndrawbacks.\nA. SWA-Gaussian Approach\nReference [13] introduces Fig. 4, the SWA-Gaussian\n(SWAG) approach to implement Bayesian characteristics into\nDL models. The Stochastic Weight Averaging procedure\n(SWA) is to obtain a solution θSW A to be the average of\nthe weights θi after i epochs. And by denoting the diag-\nonal to be Σdiag = diag( ¯θ2 −θ2\nSW A), we have set up a\nGaussian distribution for ˜θi with mean and standard deviation\nproportional to θSW A and Σdiag respectively, which can be\nused for a Bayesian Network. This transition, denoted SWAG,\ncan allow a smooth combination of Deep Learning Networks\nand Bayesian Network to be made, enabling the ability to\ncapture uncertainty with minimal modifications to the SWA\ntraining procedure. This approach can be adopted inside Deep\nLearning Models without significant modification to the code,\nto produce a Bayesian Deep Learning Model to predict more\naccurately under uncertainty.\nFig. 3. Algorithmic implementation of SWAG.\nB. Deep Ensemble\nReference [14] introduces a method to combine Bayesian\nNetwork and Neural Network(NN) models by training multiple\nNN models by randomizing different initializations, as shown\nin Fig. 3. All the trained models will be combined into an en-\nsemble and viewed as an equivalent Bayesian Model. Although\nthis is a simple approach to combine Bayesian and Deep\nLearning characteristics, the space and time complexity of this\napproach seems very chaotic. The construction and training\nof one Deep Learning Network is complicated enough to be\nextended into multiple networks to be trained as information\nfor a Bayesian Model. However, with enough resources, this\ncould also be a viable approach.\nFig. 4. Algorithmic implementation of Deep Ensemble.\nC. Bayesian Neural Network\nReference [15] introduces Bayesian Neural Network (BNN)\nuses a concept of Variational Inference (VI). VI approximates\nthe posterior with a distribution qϕ(θ) by optimising a Monte\nCarlo estimate of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):\nL(ϕ) ≈1\nM\nM\nX\nm=1\nN\nX\nn=1\nlogp(yn|θm, xn)−KL(qϕ(θ)||p(θ)) (1)\nThen make predictions by sampling from qϕ(θ):\np(y∗|x∗, D) ≈1\nM\nM\nX\nm=1\np(y∗|x∗, θm)\n(2)\n“A common choice for qϕ(θ),” described in reference [15], is\n“the mean-field Gaussian Approximation (MFVI).”\nIV. ANALYSIS\nThere exist many approaches and methods to combine\nBayesian Models and Deep Learning Models into one so-\ncalled Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) Model or Deep\nBayesian Learning Model. The combination of the two pro-\nduces a more powerful predictive model that can not only\naccount for large-scale datasets, but also handle data with\nuncertainty. Utilizing this improved model, the classification\nof complex images with uncertainty can now be achieved. In\nthe modern day, imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnostic\nprocess of cancer development. Patients first arrange an initial\nassessment with General Practitioners (GPs) to present symp-\ntoms, GPs then refer the patient for a specialist consultation\nwhere the specialist will order imaging tests, such as X-rays,\nMRI, and CT-Scans, after the imaging results are available,\nthe specialists then use the results to determine the severity\nof cancer and prescribe treatment accordingly [16]. Based\non the process above, imaging interpretation skills are the\nkey for specialists to unlock reliable diagnosis results and\nassign treatment, any inaccurate interpretation will result in\nmistreatment, which is devastating to patients who are already\nsuffering from cancer. To maximize accuracy for the image\ninterpretation process, the BDL model is a viable approach.\nResearch using BDL models has shown excellent results so\nfar, “with over 98% accuracy, one prototype and 2 data sets\nare used for clinical diagnosis and predictions for cancer and\ndiabetes” [17]. An Accurate, Reliable, and Active Bayesian\nConvolutional Neural Network (ARA-CNN) is used to classify\nhistopathological images of colorectal cancer [18]. Shown in\nFig. 5 from [19], ARA-CNN maintains a high accuracy rate\nuntil the percentage of mislabeled images is relatively high.\nSimilarly, roughly 2400 cheek mucosa images were collected\nas data for oral cancer research [20]. These images were\nlabelled as ”normal” and ”suspicious” and given to a trained\nBayesian Deep Neural Network for classification. The results\nshow a good performance where the model has achieved\n85.6% accuracy. The research has also tested the model under\nlow image quality (data with uncertainty) and the results\nindicated the model can produce informative uncertainty esti-\nmation [21]. Without the use of BDL in cancer diagnostics, an\n11.1% error rate was reported as the average diagnosis error\nrate for all cancer types [22]. Based on the observations above,\nBDL is considerably reliable to be used in the cancer imaging\ndiagnosis process.\nFig. 5. Accuracy of ARA-CNN with mislabeled images.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, Deep Learning Models, Bayesian Models,\nand their benefits and limitations have been explored. Based\non their unique characteristics, a Bayesian Deep Learning\nModel can be developed to obtain the advantages of both\nmodels while avoiding the disadvantages. There are multiple\nways to combine both models effectively into one, however,\nthe difference in the accuracy of the combination models\nis yet to be explored. Regardless of the implementation, a\nsuccessfully designed Bayesian Deep Learning Model has\nshown success in the medical field with regard to image classi-\nfication for cancers. This paper concludes that a well-designed\nBayesian Deep Learning can be an effective approach to\ncancer diagnosis by accurately interpreting images for health\npractitioners. However, errors still exist in classification using\nthe Bayesian Deep Learning approach and there will always\nbe areas for improvement. Such improvements may include\nfinding the best way to combine the models, selecting the best\nDeep Learning and Bayesian Model before the combination,\nor even combining a third type of machine learning model\nwith the Bayesian Deep Learning Model, but these probable\nimprovements methods will not be further investigated in this\npaper.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Bray F, Laversanne M, Weiderpass E, Soerjomataram I.
