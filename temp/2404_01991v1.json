Latest estima-\ntions from UNESCO Institute for Statistics (2023)\nindicates around 213 million adults (population over\n15 years old) who could not read or write, in 2022,\nacross the sub-Saharan African region, including\nnearly 49 million young people (15-24 years old).\nIn Senegal, ANSD (2021) reports an overall illiter-\nacy rate of 48,2%, reaching 62,7% in rural area.\nLiteracy rate relates to the official language of a\ncountry. In Senegal, the official language is French\nbut is seldom spoken by the population in their\ndaily lives. Senegalese people primarily use their\nnative languages or Wolof, as a vehicular language,\nto communicate. World Bank (2021) reports that\nnearly 65% of Senegalese who do not use the In-\nternet are hindered by a lack of digital literacy. This\nis partly due to the limited (if not none at all) avail-\nability of content in the language they speak. Cur-\nrently, there is a severe lack of accessible content\nfor those who do not speak the official languages\nin Africa. The development of technologies and\ntools for the most widely spoken languages would\nenable a larger proportion of the Senegalese peo-\nple to use smartphones and applications, and to\naccess content that is still unavailable today.\nResearch work as Medhi et al. (2011) and the\nsuccess of WhatsApp voice communication show\nthat the development of conversational voice ser-\nvices in local languages is a credible and promising\nway of making services more accessible. Aker\n(2011) also suggested in that time that combining\na voice-based approach with information that can\nbe accessed through answers to common farmer\nquestions would overcome literacy challenges due\nto the common texting modes. To make progress\nin this area, robust speech recognition systems\nneed to be designed for these languages. While\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies\ntend to be mature in the languages most commonly\nfound on the Web, there is still very few solutions\ndedicated to African languages.\nIn Senegal, Wolof, Sereer, Pulaar, Joola, Ma-\nlinké and Soninké languages are recognised as\nnational languages in the Constitution, but none\nof these six languages seriously benefit from the\nmajor technological advances generated by AI. Ef-\nforts have been made to develop speech resources\nand technologies in Wolof (see section 4) but no\nresources are available for Large Vocabulary Con-\ntinuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) in Pulaar nor\nSereer. Yet, Wolof, Pulaar and Sereer languages\nare spoken in more than two-thirds of Senegal coun-\ntry (Leclerc, 2023).\nAgriculture is the primary source of income for\n2 billion people around the world (Zelezny-Green\net al., 2018). In Senegal, 55% of the population\nis involved in the agricultural value chain, includ-\ning family farming, livestock breeding, and fishing.\narXiv:2404.01991v1  [cs.CL]  2 Apr 2024\nToday, digital technologies are assisting farmers\nin expanding their businesses by enabling them\nto position themselves on marketplaces, providing\nthem with information on commodity prices, and\ngranting them access to suitable financial services.\nNonetheless, such solutions are still not appropri-\nate for farmers, particularly given the prevalence of\nwritten communication and the use of a language\nthey do not speak, when interacting with these in-\nterfaces.\nWith the intention of speech solutions development,\nthis dataset is intended to fill the gap in this area.\nPaper contribution.\nThis paper presents the\ndataset created from speech data produced and\nannotated during the Kallaama project, as well as\ntextual data gathered from the web, with the aim\nof developing voice-based solutions in local lan-\nguages.\nPaper outline.\nAfter an introduction, we present\nthe project in section 2. The targeted languages\nare described in section 3 and existing resources in\nthese languages are listed in section 4. Section 5\npresents the collection methodology, while section\n6 gives details about the dataset. Then, we present\nsome of the challenging times we faced during the\nproject in section 7 and we mention some of the\nresulted limitations in section 8. Finally, section 9\nconcludes and gives some perspectives about the\nuse of Kallaama.\n2.\nThe Kallaama project\n\"Kallaama\" means \"speech\" (from Latin \"verbum\")\nin Wolof.\n2.1.\nDescription\nAs mentioned in section 1, no resources are avail-\nable to build LVCSR systems in Pulaar nor Sereer.\nOnly a small amount exist in Wolof, but none fo-\ncus on agriculture. The Kallaama project aims to\nfill this gap by producing several dozen hours of\ntranscribed and annotated localized audio data, to\ntrain speech recognition systems in three of the\nSenegal’s main national languages: Wolof, Sereer\nand Pulaar.\nThe choice of these 3 languages was guided by\nthe number of speakers in the country. There are\naround 5 million native speakers of Wolof, 3.5 mil-\nlion native speakers of Pulaar and 1.3 million native\nspeakers of Sereer (Leclerc, 2023), which repre-\nsent three quarter of the total population. These are\nthe 3 most widely spoken languages in Senegal,\nand they are also spoken cross several borders.\nThe data produced are natural, spontaneous ut-\nterances, with vocabulary in context, designed to\ndevelop large vocabulary speech recognition mod-\nels, particularly relating to the agricultural domain.\nSpeech recognition is the main technological bar-\nrier to be overcome to develop voice-based ser-\nvices for people with little or no literacy. Agricul-\nture plays an important role in rural activities in\nSenegal. It is one of the pillars of the Senegalese\neconomy, estimated to contribute 15% of GDP in\n2022 as mentioned in the Annual Agricultural Sur-\nvey of DAPSA (2023), and a large proportion of the\npopulation remains directly dependent on it.\n2.2.\nUse case\nSeveral and local companies and start-ups in\nthe IT sector are increasingly embarking on\nthe production of AI solutions that take national\nlanguages into account.\nThese are essentially\nautomatic text or speech translation solutions,\nallowing them to expand their customer base\nand offer their services in French or English to\nusers who prefer Wolof, Pulaar, Sereer, or other\nlanguages.\nSerious initiatives also have been\nnoted in the development of multilingual chatbots\nand voicebots. However, due to the scarcity of\nnatural language data in local languages, most\nof them rely on synthetic data from machine\ntranslation systems.\nMoreover, AI models still\nonly marginally address agriculture. Yet, digital\nsolutions for agricultural extension work cover a\nrange of needs, including information delivery\nservices,\nsmall business management tools,\ntraining and skills enhancement, and financial\nservices (Zelezny-Green et al., 2018).\nThe Kallaama dataset contributes to the growth\nof the agricultural sector in Senegal. It can strength-\nens food security by providing vital information di-\nrectly in the farmers’ native language, through the\ndevelopment of voice-based services such as per-\nsonalised agricultural and financial advice to small-\nholder farmers. Besides, the produced transcrip-\ntions increase the available datasets in Senegalese\nlanguages, and will boost AI-based developments\nfor agriculture, like setting up knowledge bases,\nconversational assistants, recommendation sys-\ntems and decision support systems.\n3.\nFocus on the targeted languages\nWolof, Pulaar and Sereer languages are spoken by\nnearly 80% of native speakers in Senegal. Cissé\n(2005) indicates 43,7% of Wolof native speakers,\n23,2% of Pulaar native speakers and 14,8% of\nSereer native speakers. These three languages\nbelong to the Niger-Congo phylum and are part of\nthe North-Atlantic family group. They are toneless,\nFigure 1: Map of main languages spoken in Sene-\ngal (Leclerc, 2023)\nunlike most Niger-Congo languages1. By having a\nnational status, the three languages received an\nofficial spelling system. It is based on the Latin\ncharacters.\n3.1.\nWolof\nWolof is by far the most spoken language in Sene-\ngal. It is the native language of about 5 millon\nspeakers. The Wolof spoken in Senegal is identi-\nfied by the ISO 639-3 language code name \"wol\"2.\nBy being spoken by almost 90% of the population,\nWolof is the national language of communication,\nwidely surpassing French in terms of usage (Cissé,\n2005). On social networks, comments are mainly\nwritten in Wolof in response to articles written in\nFrench. The National Assembly provides a transla-\ntion service as 20% of MPs do not speak French.\nAdditionally, private TV and radio channels have\ndeveloped programmes in Wolof (OIF, 2022).\n3.2.\nPulaar\nPulaar is part of the Fulfulde languages. Fulfulde\nis spoken in about 20 sub-Saharan African coun-\ntries, by nearly 30 million people, from West to\nCentral Africa. \"Pulaar\" refers to the variant spo-\nken in Senegal. Pulaar is the native language of\nabout 3.5 millon of the Senegalese people, making\nit the second most widely spoken language in the\ncountry. Pulaar speakers across the country do not\nalways understand each other. Clear differences in\naccents and lexicons should be noted. There may\nbe borrowings and mutual influences between the\naccents. The Pulaar spoken in the north, consid-\nered as the reference in Senegal, used in the areas\n1As mentioned by Creissels (2019), non tonal lan-\nguages are primarily spoken in the Atlantic languages\nof western Senegal and the Bantu languages of eastern\nKenya and Tanzania (like Swahili).\n2Another variant of Wolof is spoken in Gambia, for\nwhich the ISO code is \"wof\".\nof Fouta Toro and Ferlo, is different from the one\nspoken in the south, in Fouta Djallon and Boundou\nareas, and from the centre (particularly in Saloum).\nThe economic activities practiced by the Fulani in\nthese regions are at the origin of these differences,\nwithout forgetting the mobility of populations and\ninter-cultural exchanges.\n3.3.\nSereer\nSereer language is spoken by around 1 million\nspeakers, making it the third language spoken in\nSenegal. Several dialects are spoken in Senegal\n(Renaudier, 2012), and mutual understanding be-\ntween Sereer speakers is sometimes difficult. The\nmajority of the recordings proposed in this dataset\nare in Sereer-Siin (ISO 639-3 code \"srr\") variant,\nwhich is spoken in a region between the Petite Côte\n(south of Dakar) and the Gambia, and which is\nconsidered as \"standard\" Sereer. Nonetheless, de-\npending on where the recording was made, it may\nbe in another variant. The official script is based\non the standard Sereer-Siin variant but is very little\nused for writing. The language is fundamentally\nspoken.\n4.\nExisting language resources for\nWolof, Pulaar and Sereer\nMore material (in any field of application, from lin-\nguistic description to language learning) can be\nfound in Wolof, as a vehicular language. The situ-\nation is very different with Pulaar and Sereer: as\nvernacular languages, they are mainly spoken and\nrarely written. The presence of Wolof online is pre-\nponderant against Pulaar and Sereer, reflecting its\nplace in the Senegalese society.\nTo build voice-based solutions, very few datasets\nwere released so far in Wolof. Pulaar and Sereer\nspeech datasets are nearly non-existent, excep-\ntions made from the initiatives presented below.\nBefore this work, the largest transcribed speech\ndataset in Wolof was the one collected by Gauthier\net al. (2016). It consists in 18 hours of validated\nread sentences.\nWolof is also proposed in FLEURS, a multilingual\ndataset consisting in translation of English sen-\ntences that has been read by native speakers (Con-\nneau et al., 2023).\nNelson (2022) conducted a project of large collec-\ntion of Wolof speech consisting in 519 hours of\naudio recordings, for which 6.45 hours have been\ntranscribed so far. Among the 2,018 Wolof tran-\nscriptions, we counted 608 translations in Pulaar,\n571 in Sereer but only 156 audio recordings trans-\nlated in both languages.\nFinally, the last significant work we found involving\nthe three Senegalese languages addressed in this\npaper, is part of a data collection project of isolated\nwords for keyword spotting, led by the Senegalese\nGalsen AI community (Djiba, 2021).\n5.\nCollection methodology\n5.1.\nAudio recordings and transcriptions\nAudio recordings. The recordings are about agri-\nculture. The recorded consist of farmers, agricul-\ntural advisers, and agri-food business managers.\nAll the data is produced by Jokalante, a Senegalese\ncompany specialising in the dissemination of infor-\nmation about agriculture in local languages. Type of\nrecordings comprise interactive radio programmes,\nfocus groups, voice messages, push messages\nand interviews3. Therefore, spontaneous speech is\nprevailing. Quality of audio may vary depending on\nthe type of programme. For instance, focus group\nare made outdoor and so noises may arise from\nthe outside (cars, wind, birds, additional voices). In\nradio programmes, music and jingles sometimes\nalso appear. A selection from these recordings\nwere transcribed, resulting in over a hundred hours\nof spontaneous speech in the three targeted lan-\nguages (see Section 6.1).\nTranscriptions. To produce written form of the au-\ndio recordings, we asked the transcribers to follow\nthe rules edited by the Centre of Applied Linguis-\ntics of Dakar (CLAD)4, which coordinates the ortho-\ngraphic standardization of the national languages\nin Senegal. Despite that caution, it was very dif-\nficult to obtain a standard form in the writing of\nlanguages concerned in the present work. As men-\ntioned by Robert (2022) for Wolof, official rules are\nrarely used by the population (as example, adver-\ntisements are often written with alternative forms),\neven if an official orthography is established since\n1971. The same situation appears for Pulaar and\nSereer, and this is primarily due to the fact that\nthe national languages are taught very little in the\neducation system. In addition, the transcription\nwork involved recordings of spontaneous speech,\nmaking the work all the more complex and time-\nconsuming. Transcription task was performed by\n3 students in Linguistics, in the language they na-\ntively speak. They used the dedicated Transcriber5\ntool to achieve the task. The work took 9 months\nto complete. Then, 3 qualified experts, specialised\nin the languages of the transcripts, reviewed a sub-\npart of the transcriptions produced by the students.\nAt first, we were aiming to verify half of the tran-\nscriptions produced, for each language. But it was\nan ambitious goal given the complexity and ardu-\n3For each dataset, the number of recordings per pro-\ngramme type is detailed in appendix C.\n4http://clad.ucad.sn/\n5http://trans.sourceforge.net/\nousness of the task required. Nonetheless, nearly\n13 hours of speech transcription were checked in\nWolof, 11 hours in Pulaar and 11 hours in Sereer\nwithin the allotted time.\n5.2.\nTexts collection\nSenegalese languages are low-resourced. Very\nfew data in the targeted languages were unearth.\nFirst of all, no documents on agriculture were found.\nSince the observations from Renaudier (2012) who\nmentioned that the local press is predominantly writ-\nten in French, with only a few newspapers available\nin Wolof, and that no press were available in Sereer\nat the time, the situation remains unchanged.\nMost of the written sources found were in Wolof.\nThe Wolof corpus we distribute is composed of\nthe books, Wikipedia articles (dump from summer\n2023), the first book of the New Testament, two\nhistoric blogs about Hubert Fichte (a German nov-\nelist) and Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba (a theologian),\npublicly available online articles from newspapers.\nOpen source data from the Programme Algorithme\net Solution (PAS) challenge6, organised by the In-\nstitution des Algorithmes du Sénégal (IAS), have\nalso been included. Written data in Wolof can also\nbe retrieve from open source research projects (in\nparticular, the ALFFA project7 and Masakhane8).\nWe choose not to add them to our release as they\nare already clean and easy to get.\nWe found a very little amount of writings in Pu-\nlaar9. We extended our data research to include\nvarieties spoken in regions bordering Senegal, and\nfinally found more websites written in this language,\nparticularly in Mauritania.\nAbout Sereer, although it is the third most\nwidely spoken language in Senegal, gathering\nwritten data poses a significant challenge. Despite\nextensive research, no textual content was found\non the consulted websites. We even went to the\ntwo main university of linguistic and language\nlibraries in Dakar (Cheikh Anta Diop University\n(UCAD) and to the Institut Fondamental d’Afrique\nNoire (IFAN)), and only found two books written\nin Sereer.\nWe still tried to apply some Optical\nCharacters Recognition (OCR) tools to convert it\ninto digital texts, but the special characters existing\nin Sereer were not recognised.\nWe have deliberately excluded all social net-\nworks in order to avoid biases that could be\n6https://www.ias.sn/pas\n7https://github.com/getalp/ALFFA_PUBL\nIC\n8https://github.com/masakhane-io/masa\nkhane-ner/\n9Without distinction of dialectal variants spoken in\nSenegal.\ninduced in future models.\nFor example, Dione\n(2016) observed, in her study on the online usage\nof Wolof and Sereer languages, that most internet\nusers use French and Wolof alternatively in a\nsingle message.\nBesides, Wolof and Pulaar\nare the only two national languages present\non the websites consulted by the author, while\nSereer is also his subject of study. Moreover, the\nauthor indicates that internet users use Wolof\nto criticise, to display political choices and con-\nnivance, and to insult. For all these reasons, we\npreferred not to collect textual data from the forums.\nThese text corpora can be used to train mono-\nlingual and multilingual language models on the\ntheme of agriculture.\nLanguage models are in-\nvolved in various NLP tasks, such as ASR rescor-\ning or natural language understanding/generation\n(NLU/NLG) modelling.\n5.3.\nLexicon\nWe found no dictionary with word pronunciation\nfor Pulaar and Sereer, so we could not train a\ngrapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model for these lan-\nguages.\nFor Wolof, we used the lexicon from\nALFFA project to train a G2P model, in order to gen-\nerate phonetic transcription of the Wolof speech\nset. The G2P model was trained using Phoneti-\nsaurus10. The generated phonetic symbols are in\nX-SAMPA alphabet. We provide the G2P model\nand the lexicon in a GitHub repository. It can be\nuseful to train HMM-based ASR models.\n6.\nDataset details\nThe dataset is released under the CC-BY 4.0 li-\ncense. All textual data (transcriptions, text corpus,\nlexicon) are available on GitHub11. Audio record-\nings will soon be hosted on both OpenSLR and\nZenodo platforms. Once released, URLs will be\ngiven in the GitHub repository.\n6.1.\nAudio recordings and transcriptions\nAudio files have been converted into 16 kHz, 16-bit,\nmono channel, to fit the standard format used in\nASR. Transcriptions are provided under the original\nTranscriber format (.trs), as well as in stm NIST\nformat (.stm) as this one is more often used by\nASR toolkits.\nDetails about speech datasets are given in table 1.\n10https://github.com/AdolfVonKleist/Ph\nonetisaurus\n11https://github.com/gauthelo/kallaama\n-speech-dataset\nLanguage set\nTotal Duration\n#Turn-taking\nGender (%)\nF\nM\nWolof\n55h12\n46,907\n10.2\n89.8\nPulaar\n31h55\n16,558\n13.6\n86.4\nSereer\n38h12\n9,007\n28.0\n72.0\nOverall\n125h19\n72,472\n17.3\n82.7\nTable 1: Kallaama speech corpus overview\nThe high number of turn-taking that can be ob-\nserved in the table 1 for the Wolof set is explained\nby a larger amount of interviews and focus group,\ninvolving more people in the talk.\nThe underrepresentation of women’s voices in this\ncorpus is regrettable, but it reflects the interviews\nconducted and the women’s presence in agribusi-\nness.\nMore details are given in Appendix B, where we\nalso describe the checked subpart of the dataset.\n6.2.\nTexts collection\nThe set of texts collected in Wolof, before the\napplication of post-processing methods, totalled\n3,244,642 words. The set of texts collected in Pu-\nlaar, before the application of post-processing meth-\nods, totalled 5,462,823 words. As we said in sub-\nsection 5.2, no written data were found in Sereer.\nDuring post-processing non roman characters were\nremoved from raw texts. Punctuation has been pre-\nserved to give users greater freedom, depending\non how the corpus will be used. Finally, a new line\nwas added after each final punctuation mark (the\ndot, exclamation and question marks) while spaces\nwas added between other kind of typography mark\n(such as comma, colon, semi-colon, dash, bracket,\netc.).\nAfter these post-processing steps, the Wolof text\ncorpus contains 1,140,508 words, while the Pu-\nlaar text corpus contains 742,024 words. Detailed\nare given in table 2 and table 3, for Wolof and Pu-\nlaar respectively. This considerable reduction in\ncontent reflects the significant presence of other\nlanguages in the writings, particularly French and\nArabic (we did not apply a language identification\nalgorithm, but we did remove many characters in\nthe Arabic alphabet). We also found a quite large\nnumber of Cyrillic characters in the collected texts\nfrom Wikipedia.\nThe compiled data will enhance the understanding\nof the usage of the languages and strengthen the\nability to develop more robust linguistic tools. It\nwill also serve as a training baseline for language\nmodels.\n6.3.\nLexicon\nIn the aim to build ASR systems, we also provide\na pronunciation dictionary for Wolof.

Entries can also be loanwords,\nsuch as French words, since code-switching is\nfrequent in Senegal and therefore occurs in the\nspeech dataset.\nEntries are phonetically tran-\nscribed with the X-SAMPA characters.\n7.\nChallenges encountered\nTranscribers struggled to write some of the words\nbecause of the absence of certain characters on\nstandard keyboards, such as á (b-hook), Á (c-hook),\nâ (d-hook), Ò (p-hook), Ö (t-hook) which exist in\nthe spelling of African languages, in particular in\nPulaar and Sereer. The SenLangEdit visual key-\nboard application12, especially developed to write\nthe national languages of Senegal, still eased the\ntranscription process.\n7.1.\nWriting rules\nIt was particularly hard to find qualified experts for\nchecking the quality of the produced transcriptions.\nWe ask each expert to make a report of their\nreviews.\nFor Wolof, the expert declared that\nthe work was quite easy. To complete the work\nwithin the allocated time, he managed to check\nnearly 13 hours of speech transcriptions and the\nconclusion was very encouraging. He noted a very\ngood quality of work, with very few mistakes. In\ncontrast, the two qualified experts hired to review\nthe transcriptions in Pulaar and Sereer declared\na tedious work. In spite of this, they manage to\nverify around 11 hours of audio recordings each.\nThey raised numerous mistakes and warned us\nthat their work would be more about rewriting than\n12https://esp.sn/senlangedit-un-clavier\n-virtuel-pour-la-promotion-des-langues-n\nationales/\nsimple checking and correction.\nWe detail the\nmain mistakes found in Appendix A.\nIn fact, this assessment of the transcriptions\nquality primarily indicates a lack of written skills\nrather than a lack of attention to transcription\nquality. This is the result of attempting to transcribe\na language that has traditionally been unwritten.\nAs long as these languages are not taught to be\nwrite, there will be no good written productions.\n7.2.\nSpoken dialects\nThe fact that recordings are produced throughout\nthe Senegal13 made the transcription work much\nmore complex, because of the several dialectal\nvariations of Pulaar and Sereer which are spoken\nin the country (see sections 3.2 and 3.3). We se-\nlected the audio recordings at the very beginning\nof the project, before the transcriber hiring. But\nPulaar or Sereer transcribers sometimes listened\nto programmes recorded that they did not under-\nstand because of a conversation in a dialect that\nthey do not speak. Consequently, we had to carry\nout a second recordings collection campaign that\ntook into account the specific dialects spoken by\nthe transcribers.\nThis process also highlights the need to take ac-\ncount of the semantic subtleties between dialectal\nvarieties, especially when dealing with a particu-\nlar subject (in this case agriculture, but it could be\nhealth or finance) and illustrates the challenges in-\nherent in accurately and exhaustively preserving\nthe meaning of words in these languages.\n8.\nLimitations\nTranscription work is a very challenging task, and\nto produce a transcript from spontaneous speech,\nwhen overlapping events occur, sometimes in noisy\nenvironments, is even more so. Add to this the use\nof specialised software that is unfamiliar to the work-\ners, with keyboards that are not adapted to writing\nthe language, and the start of the work becomes\neven more tedious.\nDespite the care of all the workers involved in this\nproject, this dataset contains some transcription\nmistakes, and the spelling used may not corre-\nspond exactly to the expected standards, as pointed\nout in Section 7. Only one transcriber was selected\nper language to carry out the transcription work.\nPerhaps some mistakes could have been avoided\nif more transcribers were doing the job (supposing\nthis is possible, since the number of skilled people\nis very limited). But, due to production costs, we\n13Diouroup, Fatick, Kaffrine, Kaolack, Kebemer, Kelle,\nKoungheul, Louga, Matam, Ndoundour, Niodior, Nioro,\nPodor, Saint-Louis, Tambacound.\nhave chosen to provide the community with a larger\nset of transcribed data rather than increasing the\nnumber of transcribers. In this way, we have been\nable to increase the number of subjects covered on\nagriculture. A larger speech dataset is also more\nsuitable for large-scale studies, such as phonetic\nand phonological research on Atlantic languages,\na field where works lack.\n9.\nConclusion and Opportunities\nIn this paper, we present the work carried out to\ncreate a transcribed speech dataset on Wolof,\nPulaar and Sereer, the 3 most widely spoken\nlanguages in Senegal. This dataset comprises 55h\nof audio recordings in Wolof, 32h in Pulaar and\n38h in Sereer, all along with their corresponding\ntranscriptions. We also provide more generic text\ncorpora in Wolof and Pulaar, as well as a Wolof\nphonetic lexicon along with its G2P model. These\nresources can be used for setting up traditional\nASR systems.\nAs pointed out by many recent studies (Joshi\net al., 2020; van Esch et al., 2022; Ruder et al.,\n2022; Adebara and Abdul-Mageed, 2022), a\nlot of languages with large speaker populations\nstill are under-represented in natural language\nprocessing (NLP) studies and applications, rein-\nforcing inequalities such as knowledge access.\nWe hope that this work will stimulate interest in the\ndevelopment of applications that incorporate the\nvernacular languages of Senegal, but also that it\nwill be a source of inspiration and encouragement\nto develop the same kind of resources in order to\nprogress towards the inclusion of languages in the\nworld of AI.\nOpportunities offered by this dataset are nu-\nmerous. From a scientific perspective, the speech\ndataset released can be exploited for instance,\nto study phonetic phenomena occurring in a\nspontaneous context, to study speech interaction,\nor to study the impact of spontaneous and noisy\nspeech on recognition systems. From a technical\nperspective, this dataset can be used to solve vari-\nous AI tasks, including speech modelling (such as\nspeech-to-text or spoken language understanding),\nautomatic response modelling (as QA answering),\nand language modelling (used from scratch or\nused to fine-tuned a pre-trained multilingual model).\nFrom a technological perspective, it can be utilised\nto develop speech recognition systems, generic\nor specific to the agricultural sector, as well as\nlocalised conversational agents for answering\nquestions on agricultural topics related to the\nSenegal context and in national languages.\n10.\nAcknowledgements\nThe Kallaama project was made possible thanks to\nthe financial support from the Lacuna Fund14, the\nworld’s first collaborative effort to fund labelled data\nfor social impact.
