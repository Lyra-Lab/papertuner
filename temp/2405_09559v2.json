INTRODUCTION\nPhotoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive technique\nused to optically acquire the Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) [1].\nIts widespread adoption and ease of integration into wearable\ndevices, especially smartwatches, have made PPG a popular\nchoice for continuous and unobtrusive heart rate monitoring\ncompared to electrocardiography (ECG). However, movement\ncan introduce significant artifacts into PPG signals, com-\nplicating signal interpretation. These motion artifacts (MA)\ncan overlap the actual BVP signal, further complicating their\nremoval [2]. To address this challenge, numerous methods\nhave been proposed to estimate the heart rate (HR) of PPG\ncorrupted by MA. These methods generally fall into two\ncategories: Signal Processing (SP) and Deep Learning (DL)\napproaches.\nSP methods focus mainly on isolating the BVP component\nand minimizing the impact of MA [2]. These methods often\nuse a motion reference signal acquired from sensors such\nas accelerometers or gyroscopes to aid in MA removal [3]–\n[7]. Acceleration and angular velocity are generally agreed to\nAll authors are affiliated with the Embedded Systems Laboratory,\nEPFL, Switzerland\nCorresponding author C.K. e-mail: christodoulos.kechris@epfl.ch\nbe effective references for periodic motion but offer limited\ncorrelation with PPG signals during random movements [3].\nOnce the motion components are filtered out, HR is typically\nextracted from the filtered PPG signal by identifying its prin-\ncipal frequency component [3]–[11], which is then attributed\nto the heart activity.\nDL offers an alternative approach by combining filtering\nand HR estimation within a single model. Similarly to SP\nmethods, DL methods have used acceleration as a reference\nsignal for motion. In these models, both PPG and acceleration\nare given directly as inputs to the network and are fused by\nthe model to produce a point estimate of HR [12]–[14] or an\nHR distribution [15], [16]. The network is typically trained in\na supervised manner using synchronized ECG-derived HR as\nground truth labels. Several advanced DL techniques, includ-\ning attention [13] and data augmentation [17], have been used\nfor PPG-based HR extraction.\nExisting DL methods typically approach PPG-based HR\nestimation as a purely data-driven inference task, overlooking\nvaluable prior knowledge from the medical and signal process-\ning fields regarding BVP and PPG. Integrating task-specific\nprior knowledge into machine learning models has emerged as\na promising strategy to improve explainability, robustness, and\ngeneralizability, particularly in scenarios with limited available\ndata [18].\nIn this work, we explore the integration of prior knowledge\ninto DL models for PPG-based HR inference. We identify\nfailure cases of current DL models and propose three mecha-\nnisms to integrate prior knowledge into DL models effectively\naddressing these shortcomings. The resulting approach, which\nwe term KID-PPG, represents a knowledge-informed DL-\nbased HR inference model. To conduct our analysis, we take\nadvantage of the publicly available PPGDalia dataset [12].\nOur code for the experiments is available here: https:\n//github.com/esl-epfl/KID-PPG-Paper. Through\nthis investigation, we shed new light on the efficacy of DL\nmodels in processing PPG signals affected by MA and provide\nvaluable insights into the recoverability of the BVP under\nchallenging MA conditions. Our contributions include:\n• We identify three key factors contributing to erroneous\nHR estimations: DL models fail to separate MA from\nBVP, infer out-of-distribution HR samples, and estimate\nHR in sample affected by catastrophic MA.\n• We address these limitations by incorporating prior\nknowledge into the DL workflow: explicitly defined MA\nseparation task, guided probabilistic inference, and data\narXiv:2405.09559v2  [eess.SP]  9 Oct 2024\n2\nGENERIC COLORIZED JOURNAL, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XXXX 2024\naugmentation.\n• We design KID-PPG, a DL model for HR inference,\nachieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.96 beats\nper minute (BPM) on PPGDalia. KID-PPG also provides\nestimates of uncertainty as a proxy for the assessment of\nthe severity of the BVP artifact along with HR inference.\n• We provide an open-source package to estimate HR from\nPPG and acceleration signals to the research community,\nwhich allows to repeat all our experiments and move\nforward the field of PPG analysis on embedded devices\nand wearables. The package is available here: https:\n//github.com/esl-epfl/KID-PPG.\nII. METHODOLOGY\nWe have identified the following three key points underuti-\nlized in existing DL models for HR extraction:\n1) Robust HR tracking requires MA removal.\n2) In some cases, BVP can be degraded by MA to the\nextent that it is unrecoverable.\n3) The BVP has specific morphology and characteristics.\nThis prior-knowledge is incorporated into our DL models\nthrough three mechanisms: Explicit Source Separation, Guided\nProbabilistic Inference and Data Augmentation. An overview\nof our methodology is presented in Fig. 1.\nBVP - MA \nSource Separation \nUnrecoverable \nBVP samples\nBVP\nMorphology\nPPG\nACC\nData \nAugmentation\nProbabilistic \nInference\nOptimal \nLinear Filtering\nFig. 1: Knowledge-Informed deep-learning (DL) for heart-rate\nextraction (KID-PPG) incorporates prior knowledge on motion\nartifacts (MA), unrecoverable blood volume pulse (BVP)\nsamples, and BVP morphology into DL models through three\nmechanisms: linear filtering, probabilistic inference, and data\naugmentation. The input of KID-PPG consists of a PPG signal\nalong with an accelerometer signal. The linear filter ( ˆfmix)\nseparates the BVP from MA to produce a filtered PPG signal,\nwhich serves as an input to the DL model (h). The model\nuses probabilistic inference to assess the degradation of the\nPPG signal and uses data augmentation to better characterize\nthe BVP morphology.\nA. Motion Artifact Removal\nAn inherent challenge in HR inference based on PPG is the\nmixing of MA components (xMA(t)) with heart-related BVP\n(xbvp(t)) through a mixing process denoted as fmix:\nxppg(t) = fmix(xbvp(t), xMA(t), t)\n(1)\nAs is common practice, HR is inferred on 8-second windows\nwith a 2-second overlap [4], [5], [12]–[16], [19]–[21]. Hence,\nthe i-th 8-second PPG sample is denoted as the (N × 1)\nvector xppgi\n= [xppg(ti), xppg(ti + ∆t), ..., xppg(ti + 8)],\nwhere ∆t =\n1\nfs , fs is the sensor’s sampling frequency, and\nN = 8sec · fs samples. Similarly, the corresponding BVP\nis denoted as xbvpi. The 3-axis acceleration (ACC) samples\nform the (N × 3) matrix Xacci = [xaccxi, xaccyi, xacczi].\nRobust HR inference depends on the heartbeat-related xbvp [4].\nHowever, MA can significantly distort the morphology of BVP\nin the PPG observation (Eq. 1) [5]. Many SP methods employ\nsource separation to approximate the unmixing process f −1\nmix,\nallowing the HR inference module to rely on an approximation\nˆxbvp(t) ≈xbvp(t) [3]–[5], [19], thus mitigating the effect of\nMA.\nIn contrast, training a deep end-to-end HR estimator, g(·),\nwith inputs [xppgi, Xacci], for the HR inference task, [12]–\n[16], [20], [21], does not guarantee modeling of the unmixing\nprocess, namely:\ng = ˆf −1\nmix ◦h\n(2)\nwhere h(·) is an estimator of HR after component unmixing.\nInstead, the network may employ various fusion strategies\ng = ffusion ◦h′, where h′ is an HR estimator after the\ntwo modalities have been fused by ffusion. The convergence\ncriterion for ffusion is the minimization of the HR loss, e.g.\nthe MAE. Thus, this approach does not ensure BVP-based\nHR inference and may allow the network to learn spurious\nrelations with the motion signals [22].\nTherefore, we propose the inclusion of an explicitly defined\nsource separation task to disentangle the BVP component from\nMA. Without loss of generality, we model the motion artifact\nmixing fmix as a linear process [7], [23], although other\napproaches are available [24], [25]. Furthermore, we assume\nthat fmix is a stationary process and that hand acceleration is\na suitable reference signal for xMA(t) [3]. Hence, Eq. 1 can\nbe written as:\nxppg(t) = xbvp(t)\n+ Amix ∗[xaccx(t), xaccy(t), xaccz(t)] + noise(t)\n(3)\nwhere Amix is a spatio-temporal mixing filter, xaccx, xaccy,\nxaccz are the accelerations of the hand on the corresponding\naxis, and ∗is the convolution operation. Separating the motion\nartifacts involves estimating the approximation ˆAmix ≈Amix.\nTo estimate ˆAmix we use a linear two-layer convolutional\nnetwork denoted as ˆfmix (Fig. 2). The first convolutional\nlayer applies linear spatio-temporal filtering on the 3-channel\naccelerometer signals, while the second layer merges the three\nchannels into one MA estimation.\nSimilarly to [7], we train ˆfmix in an unsupervised manner\non pairs (Xacci, xppgi) using an adaptive filter loss function,\ndenoted as Ladapt:\nLadapt =\nMSE\n\u0010\nFFT{ ˆfmix(Xacci)}, FFT{xppgi}\n\u0011\n(4)\nHere, MSE represents the Mean Squared Error, defined as\nE[Error2], and FFT{·} denotes the Fast Fourier Transform.\nC.

A linear two-layer convolutional network takes the\nthree axis of the accelerometer signal as an input (xacc along\nwith the PPG (xppg) to produce a filtered PPG signal (ˆxbvp).\nOnce the training converges, we use the resulting ˆfmix to\nestimate ˆxbvp ≈xbvp:\nˆxbvp = xppg −ˆfmix(Xacc)\n(5)\nThe estimated ˆxbvp is then inputted into a DL model,\ndenoted as h (Eq. 2).\nB. Temporal Attention Model\nA convolutional neural network based on [13] is used to\nextract an embedding Wi for each sample ˆxbvpi.\nHR temporal relationships are usually modeled as a smooth-\ning filter during post-processing, reducing temporal granu-\nlarity, or with LSTMs, increasing the model’s complexity.\nWe propose to model the temporal relationship between two\nconsecutive samples as an attention operation. This approach\nallows us to consider the progression of the PPG signal\nembeddings while maintaining temporal granularity and com-\nputational simplicity. Let Ei−1, Ei denote the embeddings\nof two consecutive PPG frames. The multi-head temporal\nattention operation can be defined as [13], [26]:\nAttentionT emp(Ei, Ei−1) = softmax\n\u0012EiET\ni−1\n√\nd\n\u0013\nEi−1\n(6)\nwhere d is the dimensionality of the embedding. Addition-\nally, we incorporate a residual connection [26], [27]: Ei +\nAttentionT emp(Ei, Ei−1).\nC. Guided Probabilistic Heart Rate Extraction\nThe DL models discussed in [12]–[14] and Sub-sections\nII-A and II-B produce a point estimate of HR, implying\nthat each sensor readout value contains a BVP component\nwhich can be isolated. However, in real-world conditions,\nthe BVP component might be degraded beyond the point of\nreconstruction, leaving the MA component as the sole source\nof information in the PPG sample, Eq. 1. If xbvp(t) is not\nobserved, the model performs HR extraction on irrelevant\ninformation, Eq. 1. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 where the\nBVP component is severely degraded, yet a point-estimate DL\nmodel continues to infer HR (Q-PPG [14]) .\nTo address this issue, we propose to design the model as\na probability estimator of HR. Specifically, we choose the\nnormal distribution parameterized as HR ∼N(µhr, σ2\nhr).\nInspired by [16] and [28], we model the heteroscedastic\naleatoric uncertainty using a two-unit fully connected output to\nrepresent both µhr and σhr. If no heart-related information is\navailable in the PPG sample, then any physiologically valid\nheart rate is possible, therefore, the HR estimator should\nproduce a large uncertainty, as depicted in Fig. 3.\nThe estimated HR distribution can also be used as an error\nclassifier. We define the error classification probability as\nperror(Thr | xppg, µhr, σhr)\n= P(µhr −Thr < HR < µhr + Thr | µhr, σhr)\n= Fµhr,σhr(µhr + Thr) −Fµhr,σhr(µhr −Thr)\n(7)\nwhere Fµhr,σhr(x) is the cumulative distribution of the Gaus-\nsian distribution N(µhr, σ2\nhr): Fµhr,σhr(x) = Φ( x−µhr\nσhr ) and\nThr is the threshold above which the error is considered\nsignificant. This error classifier predicts a high probability of\nthe HR estimation being untrustworthy (error ≥Thr) when\nperror ≥CL, where CL is the required confidence level.\nAs is usual in classifiers we set the confidence level to 0.5,\nalthough it can be freely selected to stricter values depending\non the application.\nTime (sec)\nTime (sec)\nFreq.

The error classification probability, perror is also\nillustrated. In the right sample the non-probabilistic point\nestimate HR inference of DL model is represented as a black\nvertical line (Q-PPG).\nTo improve the robustness of our error classifier, we guide\nthe network to base its HR inference on the BVP component,\nas relying on HR-inference loss only can lead to spurious\nbehavior. Fig. 4 illustrates this with a synthetic example gen-\nerated from PPGDalia (S6). Here we have manually removed\n4\nGENERIC COLORIZED JOURNAL, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XXXX 2024\nthe BVP component, by applying a bandstop filter with cut-\noff frequencies around HR, 2 · HR and 3 · HR, yet both\nthe probabilistic and the Q-PPG models continue to infer HR\n(MAE 4.11 BPM and 3.33 BPM accordingly). The probabilis-\ntic model is overconfident, with the perror(Thr = 10BPM)\nclassifier dropping only 7.44% of the samples.\nWe tackle this limitation by guiding the training process to\nmap PPG samples with severe BVP degradation to a normal\ndistribution with a high standard deviation. To do this we\ngenerate realistic samples in which the BVP component is\nextremely degraded. It has been empirically observed that in\nPPG recordings, BVP information is mainly located at the\nHR frequency, and it second and third harmonics [19], [29].\nTherefore, for each sample (xppgi, hri) in the original training\ndataset, we filter xppgi by band-stopping (Finite Input Re-\nsponse with 81 taps) the frequencies around hri, 2hri, 3hri\n(cutoff from i · hr −2.5BPM to i · hr + 2.5BPM), forming\na new signal xnoisei (Fig. 4 b, c). Using the original xppgi as\nthe seed for xnoisei helps maintain realism. Since we need a\nground truth label for the supervised training task, we create\na random HR label: hrnoisei ∼Uniform(40, 300). The\nlowest HR value is set to account for slower HR [30] and\nthe highest reflects the theoretical maximum human HR [31].\nThe pair (xnoisei, hrnoisei) is then added to the set of auxiliary\nadversarial examples. 50% of the adversarial examples set is\nrandomly sampled to form the adversarial-examples-subset.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFig. 4: Inference after filtering the BVP component out of\nthe PPG.

Both\nQ-PPG and probabilistic models estimate HR close to the\nground truth, indicating potential learned shortcuts since there\nis no heart rate information in the signals. In contrast, the\nguided probabilistic model estimates a large standard deviation\nidentifying the lack of relevant information.\nIn summary, by adopting a probabilistic approach to HR\nestimation and guiding the network to focus on the BVP\ncomponent, we aim to improve the reliability of HR inference\nfrom PPG signals.

Data Augmentation\nWe propose a data augmentation scheme to address the\nlimited number of high HR samples in the available datasets,\nsimilarly to [17]. After removing the MA with fmix, from\nthe samples of the training set, we generate synthetic PPG\nwaveforms corresponding to higher heart rate frequencies,\nforming the high-heart-rate training subset. The following\nprocedure is followed:\n1) Locate the 8-sec. samples designated as clean PPG for\nwhich the main frequency component is close to the\nground truth HR.\n2) Artificially speed up the sample by x2.\n3) Discard samples with HR ≥300BPM ( [31]).\nThe original training dataset, the high-heart-rate and\nadversarial-examples-subset subsets are then merged into the\nfinal training set.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nFor our experiments we use the publicly available PPGDalia\ndata [12]. This dataset comprises synchronized ECG and\nwrist-worn PPG and acceleration recordings from 15 subjects,\nwith approximately two-hour recording sessions per subject.\nThe PPG and acceleration signals were collected using the\nEmpatica E4 wristband. During the two-hour session, the\nsubjects underwent diverse activities to simulate daily life\nconditions: resting, ascending/descending stairs, playing table\nsoccer, cycling, driving a car, having lunch, walking and\nworking in an office. Between the activities there is a transition\nC. KECHRIS et al.: PREPARATION OF PAPER FOR IEEE TRANSACTIONS IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING\n5\nperiod. A systematic temporal shift between PPG and ACC\nwas identified and manually corrected. The ECG-based HR\nprovided in the dataset serves as the ground truth. We adopt\nthe leave-one-subject-out cross-validation procedure proposed\nin [12] for all experiments.\nAdditionally, to showcase KID-PPG’s generalizability we\nvalidate a pre-trained model on the WESAD dataset [32].\nWESAD is comprised of recordings from 15 subjects. The\nsession for each subject involves activities evoking various\nstress levels. More details on the activities can be found in\nthe original publication [32]. We select a model trained during\nthe PPGDalia cross-validation process and validate it on all the\nsubjects of WESAD without any further training.\nFor the MA removal step, we train an adaptive model\nseparately for each subject and activity given that converging\nˆfmix using Ladapt, Eq. 4, requires stationarity of the fmix\nprocess. We employ The MAE loss function and the stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) to converge the model (lr = 1e −\n7, momentum = 1e −2).\nTo evaluate the MA removal step, we employ the Q-PPG\n[14], Attention Model [13] and Temporal Attention model\n(Sub-section II-B) as HR inference models, h Eq. 2. For the\nQ-PPG and Attention models we used the hyperparameters\nreported in [14] and [13], respectively. The Temporal Attention\nmodel was trained using Adam optimizer (lr = 0.0005, β1 =\n0.9, β2 = 0.999, ϵ = 1e −08).\nThe probabilistic models where trained using the negative\nlog-likelihood (NLL) loss and the same training strategy used\nfor the non-probabilistic ones. NLL is also used to evaluate\ntheir performance. Furthermore, we use the True Positive Rate\n(TPR) and the F1 score to evaluate the classifier perror for\nits ability to correctly identify untrustworthy samples. We\nconsider a positive classification when the error classifier\npredicts a high probability of error, perror(Thr) ≤0.5, the\nerror threshold was arbitrarily selected at Thr = 10BPM.\nA summary of all experiments is presented in Table I.\nPPGDalia\nBase models\n• Q-PPG\nIntroduced in A.

RESULTS\nA. Results on Motion Artifact Removal\nThe adaptive linear filter effectively removes MA that\nare linearly coupled with acceleration signals. An illustrative\nexample is provided in Fig. 6 for subjects S6 during an episode\nwhere the subject is walking up and down stairs. The DL\nmodel alone fails to decouple motion information, resulting in\nsignificant errors (activity MAE 13.66 BPM). In contrast, the\nAdaptive + DL Model combination substantially reduces the\nerror (activity MAE 2.74 BPM). In particular, during periods\nwhen Q-PPG loses track of the HR, the BVP signal, located\nat hr and 2 · hr, remains discernible and thus the loss of HR\ntracking is not attributed to severe degradation of BVP due to\nMA.\nSimilarly, for S5 (Fig. 7), the BVP component is visually\nidentifiable, yet the DL model fails to disentangle it from MA\n(activity MAE 69.96 BPM). Our filtering approach effectively\nisolates the BVP, resulting in lower HR inference error (activ-\nity MAE 24.96 BPM). However, during certain periods, 20-\n40sec. and 80-100sec., the DL model loses track of the HR.\nWe discuss this further in Sub-section IV-B.\nFor S9 (Fig. 7) the situation differs slightly. MA removal\nstill outperforms the DL model, with Q-PPG stairs activity\nMAE 16.91 BPM vs. MAE 10.37 BPM for the Adaptive + Q-\nPPG. However, in this case, MA degradation is more severe,\nand the MA component is not linearly coupled with ACC.\nConsequently, the DL model sometimes loses track of the HR\neven after the MA removal step. This limitation is addressed\nby the error classifier.\nThe overall per-subject results are presented in Table II.\nBoth Q-PPG and the Attention models perform better when\ndata are preprocessed by the adaptive step, with MAE 4.81\nBPM (Q-PPG) vs. 3.98 (Q-PPG with adaptive step) and MAE\n4.44 vs. 3.70 for the Attention model. Notably, adding a\npreprocessing step to Q-PPG outperforms the original Atten-\ntion model. For all but one subject, S9, the best performing\nmodel is obtained by employing the adaptive preprocessing\nstep (Table II).\nB. High-HR Augmentation\nTraining with High-HR augmentation results in a higher\nMAE (3.79 BPM) compared to not augmenting (3.70 BPM).\nSubjects S1, S5, S8 and 13 benefited from the augmentation\n(Table II). High-HR augmentation teaches the model to infer\nHR in a broader range than that of the original dataset\n(Fig. 8). In Fig. 8 the HR inference error for S5 during\nStairs activity decreases MAE from 25.33BPM to 6.73BPM.\nConsequently, for the augmented model, there is a wider\nrange of MA components that can be mistakenly inferred as\nHR. Additionally, the expected HR is now artificially inflated,\nleading to higher errors in considerably degraded samples in\nwhich HR inference reflects the HR distribution encoded in\nthe model weights . As a result, the model’s overall MAE\nis increased. This limitation is addressed by the probabilistic\nmechanism (Sub-section IV-C).\n6\nGENERIC COLORIZED JOURNAL, VOL. XX, NO.

DISCUSSION\nOur analysis provides novel insights into the challenges\nof PPG-based HR inference, particularly within the PPG-\nDalia dataset. The difficulties encountered by DL model to\naccurately estimate HR have often been attributed to out-\nof-distribution high HR samples [12], [21]. Specifically, S5\nhas been highlighted as a particularly challenging subject\n[12], [17], [21]. Our findings emphasize three key factors\ncontributing to erroneous HR estimations: DL models fail to\nseparate MA from BVP, out-of-distribution HR samples and\ncatastrophic MA.\nDL models encounter difficulties in separating linear\nMA. The introduction of an explicit linear MA separation filter\nnotably improved model performance, enabling HR inference\nin cases where the DL model alone had failed. This finding\nsuggests a possible physics-based explanation, as hinted at by\nLee et al. [3], who empirically linked wrist-worn PPG motion\nartifact components to the physical forces acting on the hand\nduring physical activities.\nOut-of-distribution HR samples have posed challenges,\nparticularly exemplified by subject S5, frequently cited in the\nliterature for its higher HR samples. Previous studies have\nreported improvement through data augmentation, particularly\nin S5 and S6 [17] . In our experiments, mainly subjects S1\nFig. 8: Effect of out-of-distribution samples on the model\ninference. (a) HR inference of the model with (orange) and\nwithout (blue) High-HR augmentation. The maximum HR\nvalue in the training set is presented with a red dashed line.\n(b) Example sample in the frequency domain along with\nmodel prediction and ground truth HR (green circle). The HR\ndistributions of the non-augmented and High-HR augmented\ntraining sets are also analyzed in the corresponding colors.\nS9\nFig. 9: Example of probabilistic output of augmented (orange)\nvs non-augmented model (blue) for subject S9 and ground\ntruth HR (green circle). For the example, its frequency domain\nrepresentation verifies that the PPG signal is considerably\ncorrupted. The augmented probabilistic model manages to\nidentify the lack of BVP content, presenting a high standard\ndeviation, in contrast to the non-augmented one.\nand S5 benefited from increased HR. A comparison between\nS5 and S6 reveals differing underlying causes of high errors,\nwith S6 primarily affected by the PPG - MA coupling, and S5\nimpacted by both MA and out-of-distribution samples.\nCatastrophic MA remains a significant challenge, par-\nticularly evident in subjects S8 and S9, which consistently\nexhibit high MAE. Despite various proposed solutions, no\none has achieved a low MAE for these two subjects (Table\nII). Furthermore, the rejection of a significant portion of\ntheir samples by KID-PPG (27.48% and 53.16% of their\nsamples respectively (Thr = 10BPM)) indicates severe BVP\ncorruption. This underscores the need for a probabilistic HR\nestimator and a robust error classifier based on the morphology\nof the BVP components.\nWhile our work has demonstrated the efficacy of explicitly\ndefining the source-separation task, real-world deployment\nscenarios, which further explore the assumption of stationarity\nof fmix, Eq. 5 are required. Deploying this solution re-\nquires identifying when ˆfmix needs to be updated, potentially\n8\nGENERIC COLORIZED JOURNAL, VOL. XX, NO.

In addition,\nother implementations of the source-separation task warrant\ninvestigation.\nIn integrating BVP-morphology-related prior knowledge\ninto KID-PPG, we have proposed a method for creating re-\nalistic PPG signals with extreme BVP degradation. Exploring\nalternative approaches to generate synthetic MA-affected PPG\nsamples and expanding the understanding of MA dynamics\nwith the BVP could inform the design of more realistic\naugmentation techniques. Evaluating MA degradation presents\nan additional challenge, as HR-inference accuracy may not\nfully reflect the level of degradation, for example Fig.4c.\nAddressing these challenges will be crucial to advancing the\nrobustness and reliability of PPG-based HR inference systems.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this study, we have introduced a novel method, called\nKID-PPG, to enhance DL models with expert knowledge\nintegration for HR inference from PPG inputs (combined with\na motion reference signal). In particular, we have proposed\nthree main knowledge integration mechanisms: Adaptive Lin-\near Filtering, Guided Probabilistic Inference, and Data Aug-\nmentation. Adaptive Filtering removes linear MA, enabling\nthe DL model to infer HR accurately even in segments\nwith high MA, thus strongly reducing MAE compared to\nexisting DL models. Probabilistic inference allows the model\nto assess the BVP degradation in input signals due to artifacts.\nUsing the proposed error classifier, the model can selectively\nretain samples with a high probability of maintaining BVP\ninformation, improving overall inference accuracy. Our guided\nprobabilistic training strategy, tailored to the morphology\nof BVP, substantially improved the robustness of the error\nclassifier. Data Augmentation extended the range of HR that\ncan be reliably inferred by the model, further enhancing its\nperformance. This work highlights the important benefits of\nintegrating expert knowledge into DL models. All in all, KID-\nPPG achieves an overall MAE of 2.85 BPM (Thr = 10BPM)\non PPGDalia, outperforming all reproducible methods. Our\nfindings demonstrated the efficacy of our approach in ad-\nvancing HR inference from PPG signals, paving the way for\nimproved healthcare monitoring and diagnostics.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis research was partially supported by the PEDESITE\nSwiss NSF Sinergia project (GA No. CRSII5 193813 / 1),\nthe RESoRT project (GA No. REG-19-019) from the Botnar\nFoundation, and by the Wyss Center for Bio and Neuro\nEngineering through funding for ESL-EPFL in the Non-\ninvasive Neuromodulation of Subcortical Structures project of\nthe Ligthhouse Partnership Agreement with EPFL.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.
