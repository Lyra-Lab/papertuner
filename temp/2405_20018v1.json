In prac-\ntical scenarios such as resource balancing [15], traffic management [12] and healthcare systems [24],\nMARL agents must operate within strict boundaries due to safety, fairness, or ethical considerations.\nA surge in interest in safe MARL has led to the rise of learning algorithms that optimize agents’\npolicies for maximum efficacy while adhering to human-imposed constraints. However, current safe\nMARL approaches rather only consider a fixed format barrier or factored shielding function generated\nby the prior knowledge [3, 8] or only consider the settling pre-designed cost function [16, 9, 17].\nThe role of natural language constraints in Safe MARL is crucial, but it is often ignored. Human\nlanguages offer an intuitive and easily accessible medium for describing constraints, not only for\nmachine learning experts or system developers but also for potential end-users who interact with\nagents such as household robots. However, a shortcoming of current safe MARL methods lies in their\ninability to adapt to the nuances of human language constraints. First, the natural language constraints\nare challenging to estimate and incorporate into a numerical cost function due to their diverse and\ncontext-specific nature.In many real-world scenarios, unlike the designed cost functions, humans often\nimplement a range of natural language constraints to address security concerns preemptively. This is\nparticularly true if new language-based constraints emerge, tailored to specific needs and situations,\nwhich these pre-designed cost functions fail to anticipate. For example, a language constraint could\n1\narXiv:2405.20018v1  [cs.MA]  30 May 2024\n Instruction\nThose four agents can not cross the pond\nbecause it will damage the circuits!\nHuman\nEnvironemnt\nTexted Observation\nThere are two agents in the plane.\nAgent 1 in Red: Three obstacles can be seen, the\nnearest is a hazard pool, the other two are slightly\nfurther away, and the target area is to my left.\nAgent 2 in Blue: Two obstacles can be seen, the\nnearest is a vase block, and the other one is slightly\nfurther away, and I can not see the target area in my\nview.\nAgent 3, 4 ... \nEnvironment\nDescription\nTextual\nConstraints\nFigure 1: The framework of the SMALL. Initially, humans will create natural language constraints\nfor the environment and agents. Firstly, SMALL uses the decoder language model to condense\nthe semantic meaning of the nature of human instruction and eliminate ambiguity and redundancy.\nSecondly, the encoder Language Model encodes the condensed constraints and environment de-\nscription from the text-based observations into embeddings El and Ei\no,t according to their semantic\nmeaning. Lastly, the cost prediction model uses those embeddings as input and predicts the constraint\nis violated (predicted the cost ˆcn\nt for each agent). In the end, the policy network will update using the\nprediction cost and the embeddings.\nbe stated as, ‘Avoid blue obstacles, which indicate danger.’ By articulating constraints in natural\nlanguage, users can easily define safety standards, operational limits, and ethical boundaries, making\nthe technology more accessible and controllable. Second, the challenge of adapting to linguistic\nconstraints is considerably magnified due to the complexity of inter-agent decision-making, where\nmultiple agents need not only to understand and respond to language-based instructions individually\nbut also maintain cooperation with other agents. The inability of pre-designed cost functions to\nadapt to these rapidly evolving and diverse language constraints can lead to significant operational\ninefficiencies and increased risks.\nIn this paper, we propose a new method for learning a policy with language constraint prediction to\naddress the challenge of safe MARL with natural language, named Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement\nLearning with natural Language constraints (SMALL). As illustrated in Figure 1, initially, we employ\nthe large language model (LLM) to summarize the linguistic description of the constraints, aiming to\nalign them with the environment setting and disambiguate them to extract semantics. LLMs [2, 26]\nare fine-tuned on extensive corpora and are consistent with human values, making them adept at\nextracting high-quality constraints. Subsequently, we utilize a cost learning module to learn how\nwell the natural language constraints align with the textual descriptions of the environment and\nto estimate the cost of constraint violations based on semantic similarities. This allows agents to\nadjust their policies to enforce these constraints while learning the task. Additionally, to evaluate the\neffectiveness of our approach, we have developed the first safe multi-agent benchmark incorporating\nnatural language constraints, termed LaMaSafe.\nTo summarize, our paper presents three main contributions. First, we are the first to introduce safe\nMARL with natural language constraints. This significantly improves the traditional cost function\napproach by allowing complex, free-form constraints for safer and more adaptable multi-agent\nscenarios. Second, we have developed LaMaSafe, a pioneering benchmark for more realistic safety\nconstraint scenarios in MARL. This benchmark is designed to rigorously evaluate the performance\nof various algorithms under the unique challenges posed by free-form natural language constraints.\nThird, we introduce SMALL, a novel method for enhancing safety in MARL environments. The\nempirical results in both discrete and continuous action settings environments demonstrate that\nSMALL can achieve comparable rewards to other MARL algorithms while significantly reducing\nconstraint violations.\n2\n2\nRelated Work\nIn this section, we will explore three interconnected areas: the relatively safe MARL and its baselines,\nthe role of natural language in enhancing MARL to follow human instructions, and the work on\nLanguage Models related to our approach.\nSafe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Despite the significant attention given to safe MARL\nin recent years, many safety-related challenges remain unresolved [10], such as dealing with natural\nlanguage constraints. Several approaches have been proposed to address the safety problem by\nusing fixed pre-design cost functions. The safe model-free MARL algorithms MACPO and MAPPO-\nLagrange [9], which are the safe extensions of HATRPO [14] and MAPPO [31] respectively. However,\nthese methods are not guaranteed to work under free-form language constraints and are unable to\ndeal with multiple constraints simultaneously. Other research directions include approaches based\non the shielding and barrier functions [8, 3], but these methods require pre-training or strong prior\nknowledge to create barriers that filter actions and cannot generalize to new scenarios, and these\nbarrier functions will change if constraints change.\nConstraints with Natural Language: Previous works used natural language to constrain agents\nto behave safely under a single agent setting. Prakash et al. [20] trained a constraint checker in a\nsupervised fashion to predict whether the natural language constraints are violated and guide RL\nagents to learn safe policies. During training, a ground-truth cost for each constraint was required\nto train the constraint checker. However, this approach may not be feasible if the constraint or\nlanguage structure changes during the application. Yang et al. [30] trained a constraint interpreter to\npredict which entities in the environment may be relevant to the constraint and used the interpreter to\npredict costs. Their approach did not rely on a ground-truth cost, but the interpreter had to model\nand predict all entities in the environment. This necessitated a constraint in a similar structure,\nwhich could result in inaccurate outcomes in complex tasks since the cost prediction model cannot\nhandle free-form language. Our method, in contrast, utilizes Language Models to predict constraint\nviolations, eliminating the need for ground-truth costs and extra training modules.\nLanguage Models: In recent years, LMs based on utilizing Transformers [28] have attracted great\nattention. For example, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) [6] focuses\non extracting semantic meaning and learning representations for text inputs by joint conditioning on\ntheir context, which can be easily fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Models such as the GPT [2] and\nLlama [26] have been developed to generate text by incorporating extensive prior knowledge with\nan emphasis on the decoder aspect. These models are trained to create text based on the preceding\ncontext and have shown proficiency in text-generation tasks. As Language Models provide the\npotential to align human language with policy learning and decision-making domains, previous\nresearch has attempted to introduce Language Models into MARL [4]. However, to the best of our\nknowledge, our work is the first to apply the fine-tuned LMs to the field of Safe MARL specifically\nto tackle natural language constraint challenges.\n3\nPreliminaries\nConstrained Markov Game [1, 9] is defined by a tuple ⟨N, S, A, P, R, γ, C, d⟩, where N =\n{1, ..., n} is the set of agents, S is the state space, A is the action space, P : S × A × S →R is the\nprobabilistic transition function, R : S × A →R is the team reward function, C : S × A →R is\nthe set of cost functions, d it the constraint violation budget and γ ∈[0, 1) is the discount factor. At\ntime step t, the agents are in state st, and each agent i chooses an action ai\nt according to its policy\nπi \u0000ai | st\n\u0001\n. The joint action represented by at =\n\u0000a1\nt, . . . , an\nt\n\u0001\n, and π(a | s) = Qn\ni=1 πi \u0000ai | s\n\u0001\ndenotes joint policies. All agents will receive the team reward rt and the cost ci\nt for each agent. In\nthis paper, we consider the fully-cooperative setting, where all agents aim to maximize the expected\nteam reward,\nJr(π) ≜Es0∼ρ0,a0:∞∼π,s1:∞∼P\n\" ∞\nX\nt=0\nγtR (st, at)\n#\n(1)\nand minimize the accumulated cost by simultaneously satisfying the constraints\nJc(π) ≜Es0∼ρ0,a0:∞∼π,s1:∞∼P\n\" ∞\nX\nt=0\nγtC ( st, at)\n#\n(2)\n3\nThe objective of the constrained Markov game is to find the optimal joint policy π∗that maximizes\nthe expected team reward while satisfying the cost constraints, i.e.,\nπ∗= arg max\nπ\nJr(π), s.t. Jc(π) ≤d.\n(3)\nIn the traditional Constrained Markov Game formulation, the cost function C plays a crucial role in\nquantifying the degree of constraint violation. However, this predefined cost function has limitations\nin practice, such as requiring extensive domain knowledge for design and lacking flexibility to adapt\nto dynamic and unstructured constraints.\n4\nMethodology\nIn this section, we introduce the Language Constrained Markov Game and present our safe MARL\nmethod called SMALL, which consists of a Cost Learning Module to anticipate constraint viola-\ntions using Language Models and a Multi-Agent Policy Network for action generation based on\nenvironment observations and insights from cost learning.\n4.1\nLanguage Constrained Markov Game\nWe consider the problem where the cost function C is not known but instead derived from some\nfree-form natural language. Thus, instead of a Constrained Markov Game, we model the problem as\nthe tuple ⟨N, S, A, P, R, γ, Pc, L, C, d⟩. In contrast to the Constrained Markov Game, this Language\nConstrained Markov Game is augmented by a constraint transformation function Pc and natural\nlanguage constraint space L, where Pc : L →Cl maps some natural language constraint l ∈L to\na cost function Cl, where Cl : S × A →{0, 1} decides whether the agent has violated the natural\nlanguage constraints. Under this setting, agents only know the natural language constraint l but lack\nthe knowledge of the ground-truth cost Cl(st, at). In this paper, we sample the natural language\nconstraint l at the beginning of each episode and use it throughout the subsequent training phase. We\nassume that each l corresponds to a cost function Cl. However, l may contain redundant or irrelevant\ninformation. Therefore, we introduce a simplified version of the constraint, denoted as lc, which is\nobtained by removing the redundant information from l. We will use the variable lc to refer to these\nsimplified natural language constraints in the rest of the paper.\n4.2\nCost Learning Module\nWe design a cost learning module to convert natural language descriptions into costs for safety control.\nThe first step involves summarizing natural language instructions by channelling the language input l\nthrough a large language model (LLM). This step is crucial for condensing verbose and potentially\nsemantically ambiguous free-form language constraints into a concise representation lc. To efficiently\nmanage this complexity and ensure a clear understanding of the constraints, we leverage the LLM\nfor this induction phase. LLMs, such as GPT-3.5 [2], align well with human values and are adept\nat disambiguating and summarizing the essence of natural language constraints. Following this, we\ntrain a model to extract semantic information from the natural language constraint lc, converting\nit into a constraint embedding El. To learn these embeddings El, we introduce a model based on\nBERT [6], an encoder-decoder language model, and fine-tune it using contrastive learning. We use\ntriplet loss, where a positive and a negative sample are simultaneously taken as input with the anchor\nsample, defined as follows:\nLtri = 1\nn\nn\nX\nk=1\n[max(0, α + dist(Ek\nl1, Ek\nl2) −dist(Ek\nl1, Ek\nl3))]\n(4)\nwhere Ek\nl1, Ek\nl2 and Ek\nl3 represent the embeddings of the k-th natural language constraint triplet\n(l1\nk, l2\nk, l3\nk), the α is the margin term ensures a minimum separation between positive and negative\nexamples in the embedding space. Particularly, Ek\nl1 is an embedding of l1\nk, the positive sample Ek\nl2 is\nan embedding of l2\nk that prohibits the agents from the same entities or behaviour to the l1\nk, and the\nnegative sample Ek\nl3 is an embedding of l3\nk that is different from or unrelated to l1\nk. The dist(·, ·),\nwhich measures the distance between embeddings, is calculated using cosine similarity in our method.\nThis encourages the model to learn embeddings where similar constraints are closer together while\ndissimilar ones are farther apart, aligning with the compacted language constraints more effectively.\nAll the mentioned embeddings are generated by encoder and decoder language models, based on\nnatural language constraints. The triplet loss helps the encoder language model to recognize the\n4\nsemantic similarity of constraints [22]. Constraints about the same entities and behaviours will have\nembeddings with high cosine similarity and vice versa.\nAfter receiving text-based observations for each agent, the encoder language model encodes them\ninto observation embeddings Eo,t = {E1\no,t, ..., En\no,t}, which capture the semantic essence of the\ncircumstances surrounding each agent i at each given timestep t. The embedding El is integrated\nwith the environment description to detect any constraint violations. Since El represents a concise\nsemantic embedding, it necessitates refining each agent’s raw text observation to align more precisely\nand accurately with the environment description. This refinement enables the prediction of costs\nusing the constraint’s semantic embedding. Our method employs a descriptor that automatically\nfilters the general representation related to entities or obstacles, ensuring that only the most pertinent\ninformation is considered. This automated filtration significantly optimizes the process of detecting\nand addressing constraint violations.\nTo determine the cost of violating constraints, we first calculate the cosine similarity between the\nconstraint embedding El and the observation embeddings Ei\no,t, denoted as sim(El, Eo,t) ∈[0, 1]n.\nHowever, we find that relying solely on this similarity score may lead to an insufficient understanding\nof the constraints. To address this issue, we introduce an additional step that queries a decoder\nlanguage model with the current text-based observation and the language constraint as a prompt,\nasking whether the constraint has been violated. The decoder outputs a binary flag vi\nt ∈0, 1, where\nvi\nt = 1 indicates that agent i has violated the constraint at timestep t, and vi\nt = 0 otherwise. We then\nmultiply the cosine similarity dist(El, Ei\no,t) with vi\nt to obtain the final predicted cost ˆci\nt for agent i:\nˆci\nt = vi\nt · dist(El, Ei\no,t), for i ∈N.\n(5)\nFor the validation query, we utilize LLMs, such as Llama3-8B [26]. This approach leverages the\ndecoders’ capability to determine constraint violations, despite their potential difficulty in explicitly\noutputting cost values. By combining the strengths of cosine similarity and the decoders’ binary\noutput, we achieve a more accurate and informative cost prediction mechanism, capitalizing on the\ncomplementary abilities of these two components.\n4.3\nMulti-Agent Policy Learning with Constraints\nAfter obtaining the predicted cost ˆC = {ˆc1\nt, ..., ˆcn\nt } from the cost learning module, we are ready to\ntrain the policy π for safe MARL agents. It is worth noting that our method does not require the\nground-truth cost under any circumstances for training or evaluation. This feature distinguishes it\nfrom other safe MARL algorithms. We integrate the cost learning module to the Multi-Agent Proxi-\nmal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) [31] and Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimisation\n(HAPPO) [14] with the Lagrange multiplier [21]. This allows the agents to maximize their rewards\nwhile adhering to specific constraints at the same time.\nDrawing an analogy to the return function Jr(π) in Equation 1, the value function Vπ(s) and the\nadvantage function Ai\nπ\n\u0000s, ai\u0001\n, we can define corresponding cost-related functions. Specifically, we\nintroduce the cost return function Jc, state cost value function V i\nc,π(s) and cost advantage function\nAi\nc(s, ai). The joint policy π can be obtained by\nπ = arg max\nπ\nJr(π) −λJc(π),\n(6)\nwhere Jc(π) = Eπ\nhP∞\nt=0 γt PN\ni ˆci\nt\ni\nis the expected cost sum of all agents, where ˆci\nt is the predicted\ncost for agent i at timestep t, and λ is the Lagrange multiplier. The training of the value function\nVπ(s) and cost value function V i\nc,π(s) is updated by minimizing the corresponding mean squared\nTD-error as\nLv = Eπ\nh\n(Rt + γVπ(st+1) −Vπ(st))2i\n,\n(7)\nLv\nc = Eπ\n\u00141\n2\n\u0000ˆci\nt + γV i\nc,π(st+1, El) −V i\nc,π(st, El)\n\u00012\u0015\n,\n(8)\nwhere El is the constraint embedding from the encoder language model, ˆci\nt is the predicted cost for\nagent i. To maximize the return Jr and minimize the cost Jc, we can adapt the PPO-clip objective\n[23] to update the policy with first-order methods. Building on this framework, we seamlessly\nintegrate this approach with the MARL algorithm, specifically leveraging the PPO-based objective\n5\nupdates to facilitate policy learning. As a result, we utilize HAPPO [14] and MAPPO [31] as the\nbackbones to develop the SMALL-HAPPO and SMALL-MAPPO algorithms, respectively. These\nalgorithms are then benchmarked against other baselines in the subsequent experimental section, with\nthe proposed method’s pseudo-code detailed in Algorithm 1.\nAlgorithm 1 Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with natural Language constraints (SMALL)\n1: Fine-tune the language constraint encoder E (Eq. 4).\n2: for each episode do\n3:\nSample language constraints l ∈L.\n4:\nUse the LLM to condense l →lc; Use the language constraint encoder E to encode lc →El.\n5:\nfor agent i = 1, . . . , n do\n6:\nRoll-out the policy with El and get trajectory {oi\nt, ai\nt, oi\nt\n′, rt}t=1,..,T .\n7:\nfor t = 1, . . . , T do\n8:\nTransform oi\nt →ˆoi\nt into compact environment description.\n9:\nEncode ˆoi\nt →Ei\no,t using the language constraint encoder E\n10:\nGet the violation vi\nt through the LLM.\n11:\nPredict cost ˆci\nt (Eq. 5).\n12:\nend for\n13:\nUpdate policy π (Eq. 6,7,8 and HAPPO / MAPPO)\n14:\nend for\n15: end for\n5\nLaMaSafe Benchmark\nAlthough researchers in the field of safe MARL have access to a diverse range of environments for\ntesting various algorithms such as Safe MAIG [11], Safety-Gymnasium [13] and SMAMuJoCo [9],\nthere remains a notable gap in the availability of safe MARL environments that incorporate natural\nlanguage constraints. As a side contribution of this paper, we propose a new language-based constraint\nsafety multi-agent environment named LaMaSafe, which contains two types of environments, namely\nthe LaMaSafe-Grid and LaMaSafe-Goal. As shown in Figure 2, LaMaSafe-Grid is a 2D discrete-\naction environment based on the Mini-Grid [5] with human language safety constraints, while\nLaMaSafe-Goal is a 3D continuous-action environment based on the Gymnasium [27]. In both\nenvironments, agents are required to navigate and complete objectives while adhering to constraints\nexpressed in free-form natural language, such as \"do not pass through the lava area\" or \"avoid\ncollisions between two agents\".\nLaMaSafe-Grid. is a 2D multi-agent navigation environment where agents operate in a grid world,\naiming to find their designated target balls. Each agent has its own ball, and finding it yields a reward\nof 3 points that linearly decays to 0.1 times its original value over the course of an episode. The\nenvironment features three types of hazardous areas: lava, water, and grass. At the beginning of each\nepisode, a natural language constraint informs the agents about the specific hazardous area they must\navoid. Agents must also maintain a safe distance from each other to prevent collisions, which incur\npenalties and increase the ground-truth cost. The objective is to maximize rewards while minimizing\nconstraint violations, which are tallied at the end of each episode. An episode terminates when all\nagents have found their respective balls or when the maximum number of timesteps (set to 300) is\nreached. The environment provides two layouts: (1) Random, where hazards are randomly scattered\nthroughout the grid world, and (2) One-Path, where the entire grid world is filled with lava, and each\nagent has only a single safe path to navigate, featuring numerous turns. The difficulty of the One-Path\nlayout lies in the fact that if the constraint requires avoiding lava, the agents can only traverse the safe\npath, while in other cases, they have the freedom to move freely. LaMaSafe-Grid incorporates both\nhazardous area avoidance and inter-agent collision prevention, requiring careful coordination and\nplanning among the agents to optimize their performance. Appendix C provides additional details of\nthe environment setting.\nLaMaSafe-Goal. is fundamentally a linguistic 3D multi-agent environment where agents control\nthree types of robots navigating upon a plane, namely the Point, Car and Ant. As a safety environment,\nit features three kinds of constraints: 1) Hazards, which are non-contact flat blue circles; 2) Vases,\nwhich are contactable pale green cubes; and 3) Collisions, where the two robots get too close to crash.\nThere are three difficulty levels, each corresponding to different quantities of hazards and vases. As a\n6\n(a) LaMaSafe-Grid: Ran-\ndom Layout\n(b) LaMaSafe-Goal (Ant):\nHard Layout, 32H/10V\nRobots must steer clear of any blue circles in the area.\nYou can’t be too close to each other.\nThe agents must not dance in the water lest they rust.\nThe agents should not follow the path of the lava\nBlue circles are to be considered danger zones – avoid them\n...\n(c) Natural Language Constraints\nHazards have been detected within 3m, 2.5m and 1m of you.\nNo hazards were detected.

The numbers behind indicate the obstacle count, in\nwhich “H” and “V” represent hazards and vases, respectively. The task’s difficulty level increases\nwith the number of hazards and vases. (c) Examples of natural language constraints employed in our\nevaluation. (d) Examples of environmental descriptions provided by the environments.\nhighlight, the environment is enriched with human-described natural language constraints, such as\n“Robots must steer clear of any blue circles in the area,” or “Agents will be injured when they collide\nwith each other and avoid crashing ”. The robots aim to reach their designated target locations while\nadhering to the natural language constraints specified at the start of each episode. Once a robot arrives\nat its target location, its goal is randomly relocated to an unoccupied position. The ground truth cost\nutilized in evaluating the experiments’ performance is dictated by the frequency of natural language\nconstraint violations. To simplify the cost calculation process, we designed all the natural language\nconstraints to prioritize avoiding hazards in both simple and abstract settings. Therefore, the cost\nmetric in the experiments is the number of times agents come into contact with hazards. Episodes\nterminate upon reaching the maximum time step, which is set to 1000 in our experiments. Please\nrefer to Appendix D for detailed descriptions and further elaboration on layouts.\n6\nExperiments\nIn this section, we evaluate our method using the LaMaSafe-Grid and LaMaSafe-Goal benchmarks.\nWe conduct experiments in various multi-agent environments. Our objective is to validate that our\nmethod, SMALL, works efficiently for safe MARL with language constraints.\n6.1\nSetup\nBaselines. We compare our method with four baselines: MAPPO [31], an algorithm that scales\nPPO to multi-agent systems by employing centralized training with decentralized execution;\nHAPPO [14], which introduces a trust region method tailored for heterogeneous agent policies;\nMAPPO-Lagrange [9], an extension of the MAPPO framework that integrates a Lagrangian approach\nto dynamically adjust constraints, thereby ensuring safer policy updates in environments with a\npre-defined cost function; and HAPPO-Lagrange, designed as an extension to HAPPO by mimicking\nthe MAPPO-Lagrange approach. For more details, please refer to Appendix E.\nMetrics. We assess the algorithms’ capability to adhere to human-provided natural language con-\nstraints while maximizing rewards. This evaluation is conducted by measuring the average reward\nobtained across three random seeds, under the condition that the agents follow the specified natural\nlanguage constraints. Intuitively, the ability to secure higher rewards under these constraints signifies\nmore effective compliance and understanding of the natural language directives.\n6.2\nMain Results\nWe demonstrate the performance of algorithms in an environment solely guided by natural language\nconstraints, comparing MAPPO and HAPPO with our methods, SMALL-MAPPO and SMALL-\nHAPPO. As shown in Figure 3, we present the learning curves for rewards and costs across different\nLaMaSafe environments and tasks, with our proposed algorithms represented by the deep green and\nred boxs. From a reward perspective, due to the need to consider various natural language constraints,\n7\nFigure 3: Comparison in Natural Language Constraints: We conducted a comparison of the\nperformance of four different algorithms, namely MAPPO, HAPPO, SMALL-MAPPO, and SMALL-\nHAPPO in LaMASafe-Grid and LaMASafe-Goal. The evaluation was based on rewards and costs\nacross different types of agents and layouts. It is important to note that the comparison of all\nalgorithms only takes into account natural language constraints. To ensure a fair comparison, we\naugmented the embedding El to the state for MAPPO and HAPPO.\nSMALL-based algorithms generally perform slightly below their backbone algorithms. However,\nthey maintain a similar level of performance and excel in more challenging scenarios, such as the\nAnt Medium and Hard layeouts. In terms of cost, a significant difference is observed. MAPPO\nand HAPPO struggle to handle natural language constraints and often incur high costs. In contrast\nto other algorithms, SMALL-based algorithms are highly efficient and converge to extremely low\ncost in almost all environments. This proves that SMALL is not only capable of understanding\nnatural language descriptions that it has never encountered before but also ensures that constraints\nare adhered to, leading to maximum team rewards while minimizing the number of violations.\n6.3\nAblation Study\nScalability to More Agents. To further investigate SMALL’s performance with an increased number\nof agents, we extended the LaMaSafe-Goal (Ant) environment from the main experiment to include\n4 agents, doubling the number of agents compared to the original setup. The natural language\nconstraints remained focused on avoiding blue hazards and preventing collisions, which significantly\nincreased the complexity and difficulty of the environment. Figure 4 (a) presents the results of this\nextended experiment. Consistent with the main results, the SMALL algorithm maintains rewards\nslightly lower than the baseline while substantially reducing the number of constraint violations.\nHowever, in 4-agent Easy and Medium layouts, the baseline algorithms (particularly HAPPO) exhibit\na convergence trend in cost performance. We hypothesize that augmenting the constraint embedding\nEl within the state representation may contribute to this behavior, drawing inspiration from the\nfindings of [25], which demonstrate that augmenting the state input of the policy network facilitates\nthe understanding of natural language constraints.\nComparison with algorithms that use the ground truth cost. We compare our algorithms with\nSafe MARL methods that use the ground truth costs for learning. This comparison explores our\nmethod’s precision in learning from natural language descriptions. As shown in Figure 4 (b), in terms\nof cost, our algorithms converge similarly, demonstrating consistent performance even in the most\nchallenging environments. Algorithms that have access to ground truth costs are considered oracles\nin this context. Consequently, most SMALL-based algorithms perform similarly or slightly worse.\nIt is noteworthy that our algorithms occasionally outperform others. We conjecture that this may stem\nfrom the cost prediction module incorrectly considering certain high-risk yet potentially beneficial\nactions (such as navigating close to hazardous zones) as acceptable. This suggests that our approach\nexcels at understanding natural language instructions and may encourage bold strategies by identifying\nopportunities for reward, even if it means breaking the rules.\n8\n≈≈\nLaMaSafe-Goal (Ant)_4Agents_Easy\nLaMaSafe-Goal (Ant)_4Agents_Med\n≈≈\n≈≈\nLaMaSafe-Goal (Ant)_4Agents_Med\nLaMaSafe-Goal (Ant)_4Agents_Easy\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4: (a) Four Agent Comparison: SMALL with MAPPO and HAPPO on the Easy, Hard level\nof LaMaSafe-Goal(Ant) involving four agents.

The first com-\nponent analyzed was the fine-tuning\nprocess. In the experimental setup,\nwe fine-tune the encoder language\nmodel (LMe) by sampling 30 triplets\n\u0000l1k, l2k, l3k\u0001\nfrom an alternative set Lfine-tune, which is distinct from the L set used in subsequent\ntraining. This step, conducted over 95 rounds, is critical for aligning the Bert with the semantics of\nthe potential natural language constraints, as outlined in Equation 4. The absence of this fine-tuning\nphase leads to inaccurate predictions by the decoder language model, resulting in suboptimal perfor-\nmance. The second ablation examines the impact of removing the decoder language model. Without\nthe decoder, the system depends solely on the encoded representation, leading to performance akin to\nnon-safe algorithms and a marked decrease in constraint adherence efficiency. The third ablation,\nremoving the descriptor, shows that directly encoding redundant textual observation will degrade\nperformance, emphasizing the importance of precise information management for effective constraint\nadherence. The last ablation, removing the vi\nt from equation 5, directly predicts the cost using the\nsimilarity score. This ablation leads to more conservative performance, resulting in lower costs and\nsignificantly lower rewards.\n7\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we introduced SMALL, a novel approach for Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\nwith Natural Language constraints. SMALL addresses the challenge of incorporating diverse and\ncontext-specific natural language constraints into MARL by utilizing fine-tuned language models\nto interpret and adhere to these constraints during policy learning. We developed the LaMaSafe\nbenchmark, which provides a pioneering suite of multi-agent environments that incorporate free-form\ntextual constraints, enabling the evaluation of various algorithms under realistic safety scenarios.\nEmpirical results demonstrate that SMALL achieves comparable rewards to other MARL algorithms\nwhile significantly reducing constraint violations, highlighting its effectiveness in understanding and\nenforcing natural language constraints.\nWhile SMALL represents a significant step forward in safe MARL with natural language constraints,\nthere are still limitations to be addressed in future work. One potential direction is to explore the\nscalability of SMALL to larger multi-agent systems with more agents and complex constraints.\nAdditionally, investigating techniques to handle ambiguous or conflicting constraints could further\nenhance the robustness of the approach. Despite these limitations, SMALL provides a solid foundation\nfor future research in this exciting and important area of safe multi-agent reinforcement learning.\n9\nReferences\n[1] E. Altman.

By introducing a\nnovel approach, SMALL, which enables MARL agents to understand and adhere to natural language\nconstraints, we contribute to the development of more accessible, adaptable, and safer multi-agent\nsystems. This breakthrough could lead to the wider adoption of MARL in various domains, such\nas robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation, where safety and compliance with\nhuman-defined constraints are of utmost importance. Our work also paves the way for more intuitive\nhuman-agent interaction, as users can specify safety requirements and operational boundaries using\nnatural language, making the technology more user-friendly and controllable.\nB\nReproducibility Statement\nTo promote transparent and accountable research practices, we have prioritized the reproducibility of\nour method. All experiments conducted in this study adhere to controlled conditions and environments,\nwith detailed descriptions of the experimental settings available in Section 6 and Appendix D,C.\nThe implementation specifics for all the baseline methods and our proposed SMALL are thoroughly\noutlined in Section 4 and Appendix E.\nC\nImplementation of the LaMaSafe-Grid\nIn this section, we will provide detailed information about LaMasafe-Grid. Firstly, we will introduce\nthe layout we used, along with their state and action space. Secondly, we will discuss the types\nof obstacles and the pre-defined ground truth cost function. Thirdly, we will show the rule-based\nimplementation of the texted observation.\n(a) Random\n(b) One-Path\nFigure 5: LaMasafe-Grid, (a) Two agents in Random layout, size 10 by 10, including 20 randomly\nplaced lava, water and grass. (b) Two agents in One-Path layout,\nC.1\nLayouts\nAccording to Figure 5, the LaMaSafe-Grid offers two distinct layouts for the agents to navigate:\nRandom and One-Path.\nIn the Random layout, the grid-world is a 14x14 matrix, where hazards (lava, water, and grass)\nare randomly scattered throughout the environment. This layout challenges the agents to adapt to\ndifferent hazard configurations in each episode while searching for the reward balls.\nThe One-Path layout, on the other hand, is an 8x8 grid-world filled entirely with lava, except for a\nsingle safe path that the agents can traverse. This path is free of hazards but features numerous turns,\nadding complexity to the agents’ navigation. If the natural language constraint requires the agents\nto avoid lava, they must strictly adhere to the safe path. However, if the constraint allows for more\nflexibility, the agents can navigate freely within the grid-world.\nIn both layouts, the agents’ objective is to collect balls, each worth a reward of 3 points. The agents\nmust cooperate to maximize their collective reward while adhering to the given natural language\nconstraints. The episode terminates when all balls have been collected or when the maximum number\nof timesteps (set to 300) is reached.\n12\nThese contrasting layouts in LaMaSafe-Grid provide diverse challenges for the agents, testing their\nability to interpret and follow natural language constraints in different hazard configurations and\nrequiring them to adapt their strategies accordingly.\nC.2\nGround Truth Cost Functions\nCollision Detection: In the grid-world setting, a collision occurs when two agents occupy the same\ngrid cell simultaneously. In such cases, a cost of 1 is assigned to the agents involved in the collision.\nHazard Detection: The cost associated with hazards depends on the human-provided constraints.\nFor example, if the human instructs the agents to avoid lava, then a cost of 1 is assigned whenever an\nagent occupies a grid cell containing lava.\nIn both environments, the costs are accumulated over time. If collisions or constraint violations occur\nacross multiple timesteps, the agents will incur cumulative costs proportional to the duration of the\nviolation. This cumulative cost calculation encourages agents to minimize the time spent in violation\nof the specified constraints.\nC.3\nTexted Observation\nIn the LaMaSafe-Grid environment, we follow a similar approach to obtain observations and process\nthem before encoding them as embedding vectors.\nRaw Texted Observation. The Raw Texted Observation in LaMaSafe-Grid is a simplified version of\nthe one used in LaMaSafetyGoal. Since the grid-world is a discrete environment, the textual descrip-\ntions of the state, observation, and action are more concise. The observations include information\nabout the agent’s current position, the locations of hazards (lava, water, grass), and the positions of\nreward balls.\nEnvironment Description. The Environment Description in LaMaSafe-Grid is a rule-based method\nthat processes the Raw Texted Observation to extract relevant information for the agents. Due to the\ndiscrete nature of the grid-world, there are only a few possible scenarios:\n• Agent on a safe tile: \"Agent is on a safe tile. No hazards detected.\"\n• Agent on a hazard tile: \"Agent is on a [hazard type] tile. Hazard detected!\"\n• Agent adjacent to a hazard tile: \"Agent is adjacent to a [hazard type] tile. Hazard nearby!\"\n• Agent adjacent to a reward ball: \"Agent is adjacent to a reward ball. Collect the ball!\"\nThese concise descriptions provide the agents with essential information about their immediate\nsurroundings, enabling them to make informed decisions based on the presence of hazards and the\nproximity of reward balls. By leveraging these textual observations, agents can effectively navigate\nthe grid-world while adhering to the given natural language constraints.\nThe simplified nature of the LaMaSafe-Grid environment allows for a more straightforward applica-\ntion of language in describing the agents’ observations and spatial relationships, demonstrating the\nversatility of the texted observation approach in both continuous and discrete multi-agent settings.\nD\nImplementation of the LaMaSafe-Goal\nIn this section, we will provide detailed information about LaMaSafe-Goal. Firstly, we will introduce\nthe agents we used, along with their state and action space. Secondly, we will discuss the types\nof obstacles and the pre-defined ground truth cost function. Thirdly, we will show the rule-based\nimplementation of the texted observation.\nD.1\nType of agents and Layouts\nAccording to Figure 6, in LaMasafet-Goal, we have a total of three different types of agents and\nthree layouts of varying difficulties. Therefore, we will compare nine different types of agents in the\nexperimental setting.\nD.2\nGround Truth Cost Functions\nThere are two types of constraints mentioned in the natural language constraints; one is to avoid\ncollision with each other, and the other one is to avoid blue hazards when achieving the objectives.\nFor evaluation and ablation, we coded those two types of constraints into the simulation, as follows,\n13\n(a) Point Agent\n(b) Car Agent\n(c) Ant Agent\n(d) Two agents Ants Easy layout,\n(8H/5V)\n(e) Two agents Ants Medium lay-\nout, (16H/5V)\n(f) Two agents Ants Hard layout,\n(24H/5V)\nFigure 6: LaMasafet-Goal, (a)-(c) Different types of the agents, including the A (e)-(f) two agents\nscenarios, and (h)-(j) four agents scenarios. The numbers in brackets represent the number of\nobstacles, while \"H\" represents a hazard and \"V\" represents a vase. The difficulty level of the game\nincreases with the increase in the number of hazards and vases. The planes of the game map are all\nsquares, each with a size of [4,4].\nCollision Detection: In the continuous 3D environment, a collision is detected when the distance\nbetween the centres of two agents’ models is less than 1 meter at any given timestep. When a collision\noccurs, a cost of 1 is assigned to the agents involved.\nHazard Detection: Blue hazards are the primary obstacles in LaMaSafe-Goal. An agent is considered\nto have violated the constraint when the distance between the edge of the agent’s model and the\ncentre of a blue hazard is less than 1 meter. In such cases, a cost is assigned to the agent.\nIn both environments, the costs are accumulated over time. If collisions or constraint violations occur\nacross multiple timesteps, the agents will incur cumulative costs proportional to the duration of the\nviolation. This cumulative cost calculation encourages agents to minimize the time spent in violation\nof the specified constraints.\nD.3\nTexted Observation\nAccording to the framework, we obtain observations from the environment. There are two steps\nbefore encoding it as an embedding vector as follows.\nRaw Texted Observation. The concept of Raw Texted Observation in the LaMaSafetyGoal environ-\nment draws inspiration from Bench LLM Deciders with gym translators1, where the traditional\nnumeric representations of state, observation, and action are transformed into textual descriptions.\nThis innovative approach extends to detailing the environment’s obstacles, emphasizing their charac-\nteristics and spatial relationship to the agents.\nEnvironment Description. The Environment Description process entails the segmentation of\nRaw Texted Observation through the use of descriptors. At its core, this method is rule-based,\nutilizing textual \"radar\" information to ascertain the position of obstacles relative to the agents.\nThis segmentation effectively breaks down the comprehensive descriptions into actionable insights,\n1https://github.com/mail-ecnu/Text-Gym-Agents\n14\nallowing agents to make informed decisions based on the proximity and nature of nearby obstacles.\nBy parsing these textual observations, agents are equipped to navigate the complexities of the\nLaMaSafetyGoal environment with an enhanced awareness of their immediate context, demonstrating\nthe practical application of language in delineating spatial relationships within a multi-agent setting.\nE\nImplementation Details\nE.1\nAlgorithm\nHere, we show the algorithm of SMALL as follows,\nAlgorithm 2 Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with natural Language constraints (SMALL)\n1: Initialize global value function network ϕ, cost value function network {ϕi\nc, ∀i ∈N}, policy\nnetwork {θi, ∀i ∈N}, decoder language model LM d and encoder language model LM e,\nLagrange Multiplier update stepsize αλ\n2: Fine-tune the LM e by using (Eq.4)\n3: for each episode do\n4:\nSample a natural language constraint l from L\n5:\nCondense and extract the semantic meaning of l to lc by utilizing LMd\n6:\nTo create the constraint embedding El, encode the condensed constraint by utilizing LMe.\n7:\nfor agent in {1, ..., n} do\n8:\nRollout the policy with constraint El and get trajectory {oi\nt, ai\nt, oi\nt\n′, rt}t=1,..,T\n9:\nfor t in {1, ..., T} do\n10:\nTransform text-based observation oi\nt into compact environment description and encode it\nwith LMe to get observation embedding Eo,ti\n11:\nPredict cost ˆci\nt (Eq. 5)\n12:\nend for\n13:\nCalculate value function loss for ϕ0 and ϕi\nc, policy loss for θi (Eq. 7, 8)\n14:\nUpdate λ by stepsize αλ\n15:\nend for\n16: end for\nTo summarize, the agents can learn to maximize the reward and minimize the constraint violations\nsimultaneously by iteratively updating the networks using Equation 7, 8. This leads to the agent\nlearning a safe policy that accomplishes the given task while trying to satisfy the natural language\nconstraints. Building on this framework, we seamlessly integrate this approach with the MARL\nalgorithm, specifically leveraging the PPO-based objective updates to facilitate policy learning. As a\nresult, we utilize HAPPO [14] and MAPPO [31] as the backbones to develop the SMALL-HAPPO\nand SMALL-MAPPO algorithms, respectively. These algorithms are then benchmarked against\nother baselines in the subsequent experimental section, with the proposed method’s pseudo-code\ndetailed in Algorithm 2.\nE.2\nBaselines / Backbones\nWe compare our method with four baselines: MAPPO [31] 2, an algorithm that scales PPO to multi-\nagent systems by employing centralized training with decentralized execution; HAPPO [14] 3, which\nintroduces a trust region method tailored for heterogeneous agent policies; MAPPO-Lagrange [9] 4,\nan extension of the MAPPO framework that integrates a Lagrangian approach to dynamically adjust\nconstraints, thereby ensuring safer policy updates in environments with a pre-defined cost function;\nand HAPPO-Lagrange, designed as an extension of HAPPO by mimicking the MAPPO-Lagrange\napproach.\nE.3\nQuery Prompt\nHere, we list the prompt for querying the validation flag vi\nt:\n2https://github.com/zoeyuchao/mappo\n3https://github.com/morning9393/HAPPO-HATRPO\n4https://github.com/chauncygu/Multi-Agent-Constrained-Policy-Optimisation\n15\nTable 2: The Hyper-parameters for SMALL.\nhyperparameters\nvalue\nhyperparameters\nvalue\nsteps per update\n100\noptimizer\nAdam\nbatch size\n1024\nlearning rate\n3 × 10−4\nhidden layer dim\n64\nγ\n0.95\nevaluation interval\n1000\nevaluation episodes\n10\nLagrangian coef\n0.78\nLagrangian lr\n1 × 10−5\nactor lr\n9 × 10−5\nppo epoch\n5\nGiven the following natural language constraints:\n{human_constraints}\nAnd the current texted observation for Agent i:\n{agent_i_texted_observation}\nPlease answer the following question with a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\":\nHas Agent i violated any of the given natural language constraints based on its current texted\nobservation?\nIn this prompt, ‘human_constraints‘ is replaced with the actual natural language constraints provided\nby the human, and ‘agent_i_texted_observation‘ is replaced with the current texted observation of\nAgent i. The LLM is asked to provide a binary response, either \"Yes\" or \"No\", indicating whether\nAgent i has violated any of the given constraints based on its current observation.\nBy using this prompt, the LLM can effectively validate the actions of each agent against the specified\nhuman constraints, contributing to the calculation of the predicted cost ˆci\nt in the SMALL algorithm.\nE.4\nHyper-parameters\nThe neural network used in training is initialized from scratch and optimized using the Adam optimizer\nwith a learning rate of 3 × 10−4. The policy learning process involves varying initial learning rates\nbased on the specific algorithm, while the hyperparameters for policy learning, including a discount\nfactor of 0.95, are consistent across all tasks.\nThe hyperparameters specific to training SMALL models can be found in Table 2. All experiments\nwere conducted on a high-performance computing (HPC) system featuring 128 Intel Xeon processors\nrunning at 2.2 GHz, 5 TB of memory, and an Nvidia A100 PCIE-40G GPU. This computational\nsetup ensures efficient processing and reliable performance throughout the experiments.\nF\nNatural Language Constraints and Fine-tuning\nTo incorporate these natural language constraints into the training process, we begin by fine-tuning\nthe language model at the start of each episode. This fine-tuning step involves randomly sampling 30\ntriplets\n\u0000lk\n1, lk\n2, lk\n3\n\u0001\nfrom an alternative set Lfine-tune, which is distinct from the L set used in subsequent\ntraining. For instance, a triplet could consist of the following constraints:\n• lk\n1: \"Robots must steer clear of any blue circles in the area.\"\n• lk\n2: \"Avoid all objects that resemble blue circular shapes.\"\n• lk\n3: \"Be careful not to collide with other robots!\"\nIn this example, lk\n1 and lk\n2 are semantically similar as they both instruct the agents to avoid blue\ncircular objects, while lk\n3 is dissimilar as it pertains to avoiding collisions with other robots.\nThe fine-tuning process, conducted over 95 rounds, is critical for aligning the BERT model with the\nsemantics of the potential natural language constraints, as outlined in Equation 4. This alignment\nenables the language model to effectively capture the relationships between different constraints and\ntheir underlying meanings.\nBy fine-tuning the language model on a diverse set of triplets from Lfine-tune, we ensure that it can\ngeneralize well to the constraints encountered during the actual training phase. This pre-training step\n16\nenhances the model’s ability to interpret and adhere to the provided natural language constraints,\nultimately leading to improved coordination and safety in the multi-agent system.\nHere we list the Natural Language Constraints for LaMaSafe-Grid,\n1. \"You have a pair of magic shoes to walk on lava and meadow. But you cannot swim. Be\ncareful not to collide with other robots!\"\n2. \"Lava and grass are safe to walk on with your special boots, but water will damage you.\nWatch out for other robots to avoid collisions!\"\n3. \"Stay away from water, even if you can handle lava and grass. Ensure you don’t bump into\nother robots!\"\n4. \"Walking on lava and grass is fine, but avoid water at all costs. Keep an eye out to avoid\nhitting other robots!\"\n5. \"Your path is clear on lava and grass, but water is dangerous. Beware of other robots to\nprevent collisions!\"\n6. \"Lava and grass won’t hurt you, but water is a no-go. Make sure not to run into other\nrobots!\"\n7. \"Lava and grass are safe terrains, but water will cause damage. Stay alert to avoid colliding\nwith other robots!\"\n8. \"Feel free to walk on lava and grass, but steer clear of water. Avoid other robots to prevent\ncollisions!\"\n9. \"Lava and grass are fine, but water is off-limits. Be cautious to avoid hitting other robots!\"\n10. \"You can cross lava and grass, but water is dangerous. Be mindful of other robots to prevent\ncollisions!\"\n11. \"Lava and grass are okay, but stay out of the water.
