Introduction \nThroughout its relatively brief history, humans have devised and mastered numerous \nlogical-mathematical symbol (LMS) systems such as logical reasoning and \ncalculation, reflecting our cultural and technological evolution. This trend continues \nwith the creation of novel LMS systems with emerging knowledge domains such as \nprogramming, showcasing the remarkable adaptability of the human mind to \nincreasingly complex cognitive challenges. In addition, the use of LMS systems to \ntackle abstract problems is attracting further interest, particularly for its potential to \nbridge the intellectual gap between artificial intelligence (AI) and human cognition. \nDespite its diverse applications and functionalities, LMS processing is theorized to \noriginate from a single foundational system, namely the logical-mathematical \nintelligence, as proposed by Gardner’s multiple intelligences theory (1983). However, \nthe exact cognitive functionality of this foundational system remains largely elusive. \nEspecially, considering that known LMS-related behaviors have emerged relatively \nrecently, within the last 6000 years (Pande, 2010), it is unlikely that a completely new \nset of neural facilities evolved specifically for this purpose. Accordingly, LMS \nprocessing may have evolved by repurposing phylogenetically more ancient cognitive \nsystems through neuronal recycling (Dehaene, 2005; Dehaene & Cohen, 2007; \nFedorenko et al., 2019; Kazanina & Poeppel, 2023).  \nThe primary systems thought to underlie LMS processing are natural language \nprocessing and spatial cognition (Dehaene & Cohen, 2007; Fedorenko et al., 2019). In \nterms of form, LMS systems bear an ostensible resemblance with natural language \n5 \n \n(Dehaene et al., 2022; Fedorenko et al., 2019). This similarity is especially evident in \nthe syntax-like operations of LMS, which are thought to parallel those in language \nprocessing (Fedorenko et al., 2019). For example, the verbal reasoning approach, which \nviews deductive reasoning, a representative LMS task, as a transformation of verbal \ninformation, relies on processes similar to those in language comprehension and \ngeneration (Krumnack et al., 2011; Polk & Newell, 1995). However, empirical evidence \nregarding the association between language and LMS processing is inconclusive, both \nin terms of correlation in behavioral performance (Fedorenko & Varley, 2016; LeFevre \net al., 2010; Prat et al., 2020; Shearer & Karanian, 2017) and identification of common \nneural correlates (Amalric & Dehaene, 2016; Castelhano et al., 2021; Coetzee et al., \n2022; Fedorenko & Varley, 2016; Floyd et al., 2017; Houdé & Tzourio-Mazoyer, 2003; \nIvanova et al., 2020; Y.-F. Liu et al., 2020; Maruyama et al., 2012; Monti et al., 2009, \n2012; Prat et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), implying the complexity of the relationship \nbetween LMS and language systems. In addition, the comparison is limited to a handful \nof representative tasks, such as prose cloze versus code function judgment, sentence \nreading versus mental programming, and syllable concatenation versus number \naddition (Endres, Karas, et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021; Zago et al., 2008), and the \nspecifics of corresponding task settings risk confounding the test of commonality (but \nsee Ikutani, Itoh, et al., 2021 for a comparison between programming comprehension \nwith the meta-analysis map of language, and Castelhano et al., 2021 for a comparison \nbetween program understanding with the meta-analysis results of reading). \nAn alternative hypothesis proposes that LMS processing is built upon spatial \n6 \n \ncognition, which views the processing of the properties and relations among non-spatial \nLMS elements dependent on spatial abilities (Dehaene & Cohen, 2007; Lin & Dillon, \n2023). For instance, the mental model theory argues that reasoning is achieved by \nmanipulating reasoning components in a visuospatial workspace, rather than a \nlinguistic medium (Johnson-Laird, 2001). Similarly, the mental simulation theory posits \nthat the ability to navigate physical environments underpins the simulation processes \nused to arrive at solutions in a logical-mathematical space (Barsalou, 2008; Hawes & \nAnsari, 2020). Supporting these theoretical models is behaviour and neural evidence \nlinking LMS processing abilities, such as numerical, arithmetical, and geometric \nabilities (Houdé & Tzourio-Mazoyer, 2003; Wei et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2020), logical \nreasoning (Goel, 2007; Houdé & Tzourio-Mazoyer, 2003; Knauff et al., 2003), \nprogramming (Helmlinger et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2019; Sharafi et al., 2021), \ncomputational thinking (Román-González et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2021), and other \nSTEM domains (Wai et al., 2009; Khine, 2017; Shea et al., 2001) to spatial ability. This \nsuggests that spatial cognition may play a critical role in facilitating LMS processing, \noffering an important perspective alongside the language-based approach. However, \nsimilar to the situation with the language hypothesis, only a handful of specific LMS \nand spatial tasks were utilized in the comparison (Endres, Fansher, et al., 2021; Endres, \nKaras, et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2019; Zago et al., 2008). For example, in our previous \nstudy (Xu et al., 2021), to infer the cognitive substrates of computational thinking, we \nbroke up the neural correlates of mental programming according to their varied pattern \nof neural resemblance with three other LMS tasks and a representative visuospatial task \n7 \n \n(mental folding), and we observed that the part showing resemblance between mental \nprogramming and other LMS tasks does not necessarily show high resemblance with \nmental folding. This leaves open a question of whether the hypothetical neural \nresemblance between LMS and spatial processing exists above task variation, being \nevident at the domain level, and whether such neural resemblance is constantly larger \nthan the LMS-language resemblance across tasks.  \n \nTo examine these two hypotheses at the domain level, here we compared the \ninvolvement of cortical regions associated with language processing and spatial \ncognition in LMS processing, respectively. Our rationale, grounded in the concept of \nneuronal recycling (Dehaene, 2005; Dehaene & Cohen, 2007), is that the basis of LMS \nprocessing is more likely to be the cognitive function whose cortical regions are \npredominantly engaged in LMS processing. The present study presented a novel \nattempt at direct and quantitative domain-level examination of the two hypotheses.  \nInstead of comparing the activation of specific tasks, we ran large-scale automated \nmeta-analyses to identify the cross-task neural correlates of language processing and \nspatial cognition, respectively. For LMS processing, with few dedicated studies, we \noperationalized it by its three core cognitive units as defined in logical-mathematical \nintelligence (Gardner, 1983), namely, calculation, logical reasoning, and problem-\nsolving, and compiled a synthesized activation map through a conjunctive analysis of \nwhole-brain univariate activations based on inhouse data of three representative tasks \nof each core unit: reasoning, calculation, and mental programming from our previous \nwork for another purpose (Xu et al., 2021). \n8 \n \nWith these meta-analysis results, we quantified and compared the domain-level \noverlap of LMS processing with language processing and spatial cognition, respectively. \nWe indeed observed greater domain-level resemblance of LMS with spatial processing \nthan with language processing, the cross-task homogeneity of which was further \nvalidated by multivariate activation pattern analysis. Finally, we used clustering \nanalysis to explore the hierarchical structure among the neural correlates of LMS \nprocessing and its functional bases. These analyses collectively revealed a notable link \nbetween LMS processing and spatial cognition, supporting the hypothesis that the root \nof LMS processing lies in spatial cognition.  \n \n2. Results \n2.1. Univariate analysis revealed more overlap of LMS processing with spatial \ncognition \nWe first investigated whether LMS processing shared neural activation to a greater \nextent with language processing or spatial cognition. To identify the neural correlates \nintrinsic to LMS processing, distinct from those linked to task-specific properties, we \nconducted a conjunctive analysis using fMRI data from three representative tasks: \nreasoning, calculation, and mental programming (see Methods 4.2.2) (Figure 1a, \nmiddle). This synthesis allowed the generation of an activation map associated with \nLMS processing embedded across these three tasks. The resulting map revealed \nbilateral activation, in the frontal lobe (the middle frontal gyrus, the inferior frontal \n9 \n \ngyrus), the supplementary motion area spanning to the cingulum, the insula, the \nposterior parietal cortex, the precuneus, and the inferior temporal gyrus (Supplemental \nFigure 1, Supplemental Table 1).  \nTo map the neural substrates of language processing and spatial cognition, we \nleveraged large-scale automated meta-analyses to generate cross-task activation maps \nfor each (see Methods 4.1) (Figure 1a, left and right). Language processing activates a \nleft-lateralized network, including the precentral and the inferior frontal gyri, the \nsupplementary motion area, and the superior and middle temporal gyri (Supplemental \nFigure 2, Supplemental Table 2). In contrast, spatial cognition recruits the bilateral \nsuperior frontal gyrus, the opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus, the supplementary \nmotion area, the insula, the superior parietal lobule spanning to the middle occipital \ngyrus, the precuneus, and the inferior occipital gyrus spanning to the fusiform \n(Supplemental Figure 3, Supplemental Table 3). These activation patterns are consistent \nwith findings from previous reviews (Cona & Scarpazza, 2019; Price, 2012).  \nFigure 1c shows the activation overlap among LMS processing, language \nprocessing, and spatial cognition. For a full list of the overlapping clusters, refer to \nSupplementary Table 4. Visual inspection shows that the activation map of LMS \nprocessing overlapped with that of language processing mainly in the left inferior \nfrontal gyrus and the left supplementary motion area. In contrast, overlap with spatial \ncognition is mainly in the bilateral posterior parietal cortex, the inferior and the middle \nfrontal gyri, the right supplementary motion area, the right insula, and the right \nprecuneus. Critically, there is substantial co-activation between LMS processing and \n10 \n \nspatial cognition, and to a somewhat lesser extent, between LMS processing and \nlanguage processing. In the neural activation of LMS processing, the voxels \noverlapping with spatial cognition (n = 1694) amount to 2.7 times the number of voxels \noverlapping with language processing (n = 634). This difference is also reflected in the \ndice coefficient, where the coefficient between spatial cognition and LMS processing \n(0.255) was larger than that between language processing and LMS processing (0.113), \nsuggesting a greater similarity in the univariate activation maps of spatial cognition and \nLMS processing. \n \n11 \n \n \nFigure 1.

(c) The overlap between the domain-level maps \nof LMS processing and either language processing or spatial cognition. \n \nTo replicate these domain-level findings and statistically compare the resemblance \nof LMS processing to either language processing or spatial cognition, we calculated the \nsubject-wise overlap between each subject’s LMS synthesized map and their fMRI \nactivation in representative language and spatial tasks, sentence processing, and mental \nfolding, respectively (see methods 4.2.2) (Figure 2a, left and right). All the subject-wise \nmaps were thresholded by a voxel-level threshold at  p = 0.001. Consistent with our \nobservations from the domain-level analysis, the dice coefficients between spatial \ncognition and LMS processing were significantly higher than those for language \nprocessing and LMS processing (t(19) = 8.825, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 2.025) (Figure \n2b, left). This result illustrates the greater similarity in neural activation of LMS \nprocessing and spatial cognition compared to that between LMS processing and \nlanguage processing. \nGiven that our synthesized LMS activation map was derived from three distinct \n13 \n \nrepresentative LMS tasks, we further asked whether our findings were consistent across \neach task. To this end, we compared the group-level activation map of each LMS task \n(corrected by FDR at  p = 0.01) with the domain-level language and spatial processing \nmaps, and further statistically tested the difference between the task-wise LMS \nactivations and those of sentence processing and mental folding. \nIn the reasoning task, overlap with spatial cognition was mainly in the bilateral \nposterior parietal cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus, the right middle frontal gyrus, the \nright insula, and the left precuneus, while overlap with language processing was mainly \nin the left inferior and middle frontal gyri, and the left supplementary motion area \n(Supplemental Figure 4). The overlap of reasoning with spatial cognition doubled the \nsize of its overlap with language processing. Consistently, the dice coefficient for \nreasoning with spatial cognition (0.280) was larger than that with language processing \n(0.170). This pattern was confirmed by a significant difference between corresponding \nsubjective dice coefficients (t(19) = 5.770, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.324) (Figure 2b, \nright).  \nSimilar patterns were observed for calculation and mental programming tasks. In \nthe calculation task, overlap with spatial cognition was mainly in the bilateral inferior \nparietal lobule, the supplementary motion area, the left middle frontal gyrus, the \nopercular part of the right inferior frontal gyrus, and the right insula, while that with \nlanguage processing was relatively limited, predominantly in the opercular part of the \nleft inferior frontal gyrus (Supplemental Figure 5). Overlap between calculation and \nspatial cognition was 1.8 times larger than its overlap with language processing, \n14 \n \nconsistent with the comparison of dice coefficients (with spatial cognition: 0.149 versus \nwith language processing: 0.053), indicating a more substantial resemblance between \nthe neural correlates of calculation and spatial cognition. This pattern was confirmed \nby a significant difference between corresponding subjective dice coefficients (t(19) = \n3.477, p < 0.01, Cohen’s d = 0.798) (Figure 2b, right).   \nIn the mental programming task, overlap with spatial cognition was mainly in the \nleft inferior parietal lobule and the left precuneus, while that with language processing \nwas mainly in the left precentral gyrus and the triangular part of the left inferior frontal \ngyrus (Supplemental Figure 6). The overlap between mental programming and spatial \ncognition is more than 10 times the size of the overlap between mental programming \nand language processing, consistent with the larger programming-spatial than \nprogramming-language dice coefficients at both the group level (with spatial cognition: \n0.065 versus language processing: 0.044) and subject level (t(19) = 5.215, p < 0.001, \nCohen’s d = 1.196) (Figure 2b, right), suggesting that the neural activation in mental \nprogramming was more similar to spatial cognition than language processing.  \nIn summary, we found substantially greater overlap in activation maps of LMS \nprocessing with spatial processing, especially in the posterior parietal cortex and \ninferior frontal gyrus, supporting the spatial origin hypothesis. \n \n15 \n \n \nFigure 2.

Similarity in activation patterns between LMS processing and spatial \ncognition \nWhile the univariate analysis above revealed that LMS processing shared more \nsimilarities with spatial cognition in terms of activation maps overlap, it is important to \nnote that a single cortical region can support distinct cognitive processes (Duncan, 2010; \nWoolgar et al., 2011, 2016). Particularly, the frontal and parietal cortex were known to \nbe functionally heterogeneous and showed substantial cross-individual variation (Blank \n& Fedorenko, 2017; Braga et al., 2019; Frost & Goebel, 2012; Ivanova et al., 2020; \nTahmasebi et al., 2012; Vázquez-Rodríguez et al., 2019). Therefore, anatomical overlap \nin activation between LMS processing and spatial cognition in these regions does not \nnecessarily imply functional similarity. To further test the hypothetical functional \nassociation between LMS and spatial processing, we examined whether the \nmultivariate activation pattern of LMS processing more closely resembled that of \nspatial cognition than language processing. For an unbiased comparison, we \ndeliberately chose cortical regions activated by both language processing and spatial \ncognition. This region of interest (ROI), delineated as the overlap between the \ncorresponding meta-analysis activation maps, was left-lateralized, encompassing the \nprecentral gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, the supplementary motor area, and the \nposterior parietal cortex, as well as the bilateral superior temporal gyrus (Supplemental \nFigure 7, Supplemental Table 5).  \nThe similarity between domains was quantified by examining the likelihood of the \nmultivariate activation patterns of LMS processing being classified as those of the \n17 \n \nrepresentative spatial task rather than those of the representative language task in the \nROI. To do this, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) for each subject, using it \nto classify the multivariate patterns of language processing, indexed by the sentence \nprocessing task, from those of spatial cognition, indexed by the mental folding task \n(Figure \n3a) \nwith \nleave-one-out \ncross-validation. \nHaving \nestablished \nthe \nboundary surface that divides multivariate patterns into two distinct classes, language \nprocessing and spatial cognition (Figure 3b), we then applied this classifier to the \nuntrained multivariate patterns of LMS processing, indexed by the three representative \ntasks (Figure 3d). The underlying rationale is that if the ROI represented LMS in a \nmanner more similar to spatial codes than to linguistic elements, then the classifier \nwould more frequently classify LMS processing as spatial cognition than language \nprocessing (Figure 3e). \nAs expected, the spatial-linguistic SVM classifier demonstrated an accuracy close \nto 100% in distinguishing the multivariate patterns of language processing from those \nof spatial cognition across all subjects (Figure 3c), demonstrating the effectiveness of \nthe classifier. Critically, when applying this classifier to the multivariate patterns of \nLMS processing in the ROI, the likelihood of LMS processing being classified as \nspatial cognition was 65%, significantly surpassing the 35% likelihood of being \nclassified as language processing (t(19) = 3.127,  p = 0.006, Cohen’s d = 0.717) (Figure \n3f). That is, in regions recruited by both language processing and spatial cognition, the \nactivation patterns elicited by LMS processing were more similar to those of spatial \ncognition than to language processing. \n18 \n \n \n \nFigure 3.

The asterisks denote the \nsignificance of the difference between the confusion rates. *p<.05, **p<.01, ***p<.001. \n \nThe observed anatomical and functional similarities between LMS processing and \nspatial cognition lead to an interesting question: Are the LMS system and the spatial \ncognition system distinct entities, with the latter supporting the former (Figure 4a)? \nAlternatively, could it be that the LMS processing is essentially one of the many \nmanifestations of spatial cognition, rendering them indistinguishable in terms of neural \ncorrelates (Figure 4b)? To test these two hypotheses, we calculated the intra-LMS \nsimilarity by averaging pairwise pattern similarities among LMS tasks (i.e., reasoning, \ncalculation, and mental programming) and the LMS-spatial similarities by averaging \nthe similarities between each LMS task and the representative spatial cognition task \n(i.e., mental folding) based on their multivariate pattern in the ROI. The underlying \nrationale is that if the LMS processing is indeed synonymous with spatial cognition, \nLMS-spatial similarity should fall within the range of intra-LMS similarity. We also \ncalculated LMS-language similarity by averaging the similarities between each LMS \ntask and the representative language task (i.e., sentence processing) in the ROI, and \nexpected it to be lower than both intra-LMS and LMS-spatial similarity. \nAs expected, the LMS-language similarity is significantly lower than both the \n20 \n \nintra-LMS similarity (t(59) = 5.978, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.778) and the LMS-spatial \nsimilarity (t(59) = 7.255, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.945). Critically, the intra-LMS \nsimilarity did not significantly exceed the LMS-spatial similarity (one-tail t(59) = -\n1.911,  p = 0.061, Cohen’s d = -0.249), challenging the hypothesis that LMS processing \nand the spatial cognition are distinct entities. This point is further supported by the \nhierarchical clustering analysis on the multivariate activation patterns of the LMS and \nspatial cognition tasks. As shown in Figure 4c, the LMS tasks did not form a distinct \ncluster separate from the spatial cognition task, revealing an intermingled relation \namong these tasks. This finding supports the idea that LMS processing likely operates \nvia the same underlying mechanisms as spatial cognition.  \n \n \nFigure 4.

Discussion \nThe ability to process logical-mathematical symbols underpins everyday human \nactivities such as calculation, reasoning, and programming. Based on the neuronal \nrecycling hypothesis (Dehaene & Cohen, 2007), we investigated the functional origin \nof this processing by comparing the neural correlates of LMS processing with those of \nlanguage processing and spatial cognition, respectively. The comparison of spatial \nextents in meta-analysis maps revealed a more substantial overlap between LMS \nprocessing and spatial cognition than that between LMS and language processing. \nFurthermore, a pattern similarity analysis revealed that the multivariate activation \npatterns of LMS processing were more similar to that of spatial cognition than language \nprocessing in regions activated by both. Taken together, our findings support the \nhypothesis that the ability of LMS processing is likely built upon spatial cognition \nrather than language processing. \nThe present study presented a novel and direct comparison of the cross-task neural \ncorrelates of LMS processing with its two hypothetical origins. The present study \ndiffered from previous studies on neural commonality between LMS and spatial \nprocessing tasks (Endres, Karas, et al., 2021; Hawes & Ansari, 2020; Huang et al., 2019; \nXu et al., 2021; Zago et al., 2008) in overcoming task idiosyncrasy by meta-analysis \nand directly comparing competing hypotheses to address the theoretical question. First, \n22 \n \nby utilizing meta-analysis we overcome the impact of task idiosyncrasy which limited \ndomain-level conclusions via task-wise comparison to mitigate the confounding factors. \nLMS tasks are integrative and idiosyncratic, given the large range of cognitive \nchallenges they target. For instance, our previous study (Xu et al., 2021) observed \ndissociable components within the cortical regions activated during mental \nprogramming, a representative LMS task, each of which showed a varied combination \nof neural resemblance with another three representative LMS tasks. Also, their \nresemblance with that of mental folding varied. This highlighted the substantial task \nidiosyncrasy in LMS processing, which leads to difficulty in evaluating LMS’s neural \nresemblances with other domains, let alone comparing its relative resemblance with \nmultiple other domains. Out of this consideration, the present study compared the cross-\ntask neural correlates of the domains in question via either meta-analysis or synthesized \nactivation map to mitigate the confounding factor of the task-specific properties in \nidentifying the neural correlates.  \nSpecifically, the cross-task map of LMS processing was generated by synthesizing \nin-house fMRI data of representative LMS tasks with image-based meta-analysis \n(Salimi-Khorshidi et al., 2009; Soares et al., 2016). The resulting map revealed bilateral \nactivation, albeit slightly right-lateralized, in the frontal lobe (the middle frontal gyrus, \nthe inferior frontal gyrus), the supplementary motion area spanning to the cingulum, \nthe insula, the posterior parietal cortex, the precuneus, and the inferior temporal gyrus. \nThis map covers most major regions previously reported in LMS tasks, including \nfindings from meta-analyses in mathematics (Hawes et al., 2019; Hawes & Ansari, \n23 \n \n2020; Tablante et al., 2023), reasoning (Hobeika et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2020), \nproblem-solving (Bartley et al., 2018; Feng et al., 2021), and programming (Castelhano \net al., 2021; Ikutani, Itoh, et al., 2021), among other representative LMS tasks (Floyd \net al., 2017; Houdé & Tzourio-Mazoyer, 2003; Huang et al., 2019; Ikutani, Kubo, et al., \n2021; Y.-F. Liu et al., 2020; Maruyama et al., 2012). By comparing this map with the \nmeta-analysis map of language and spatial processing, we observed that the overlap \nbetween LMS processing and spatial cognition mainly resided in a bilaterally \ndistributed set of frontoparietal regions, which are implicated in tasks such as arithmetic \ncalculation, formal logical inference, mental programming, mental rotation, mental \nfolding, and spatial working memory (Hawes et al., 2019; Ivanova et al., 2020; Y.-F. \nLiu et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021; Zago et al., 2008). It appears that these regions might \nbe the sites of the reuse of mechanisms for processing objects and their spatial relations. \nFor instance, the frontoparietal dorsal attention network (Corbetta & Shulman, 2002; \nKincade et al., 2005) may contribute to maintaining (Ravizza et al., 2004; Sack, 2009) \nand representing (Hanakawa et al., 2002; Pinel et al., 2001) both spatial codes and LMS, \nthe right insula may be involved in decision-making and error monitoring in both \ndomains (Castelhano et al., 2021; Uddin, 2015), and the inferior parietal lobule may be \ninvolved in retaining (Marshuetz et al., 2000) and reactivating (Corbetta et al., 2002) \nordered information in both spatial and non-spatial domains, especially in processing \nprogramming algorithms or abstract rule sets (Crittenden et al., 2016; Ikutani, Kubo, et \nal., 2021; Pischedda et al., 2017; Srikant et al., 2022; Woolgar et al., 2011).  In contrast, \nthe overlap in neural activation between LMS and language processing was \n24 \n \nsignificantly smaller, mainly localized in the left inferior frontal gyrus, including \nBroca’s area (BA45 and BA44). The involvement of these regions in LMS processing \nmay result from task characteristics, such as the text-based visual representation of \nstimuli presented in LMS tasks (Castelhano et al., 2021). In addition, while traditionally \nregarded as language-specific regions, recent studies have shown that the BA44 also \nengages in non-verbal working memory (Gould et al., 2003; Honey et al., 2000; Kong \net al., 2005; Maguire et al., 1997), and the BA45 in retrieval and selection of non-\nlinguistic information (Liakakis et al., 2011; Thompson-Schill et al., 1999). The finding \nof limited LMS-language overlap is consistent with observations that LMS systems \nemphasize repetition and symmetry, contrasting natural languages that tend to avoid \nrepetition and rely on anti-symmetry. That is, despite both LMS and language utilizing \ndiscrete symbol systems, they differ fundamentally in their structural principles \n(Dehaene et al., 2022). Taken together, the observed neural similarities in this study are \nin line with the idea that LMS processing likely originates from spatial cognition, \npossibly through a process of neuronal recycling. \nA second distinct feature of the present study is that we achieved a direct \ncomparison and placed the two hypothetical origins in a fair playground by focusing on \nthe regions where both spatial and language processing activate in analyzing \nmultivariate neural resemblance. The results further supported the spatial-origin \nhypothesis by showing that all tested LMS tasks were carried out in a way more like \nspatial than language processing when both are plausible. Note that for inferential \nstatistics we leveraged the fMRI data from the same sample of participants in a \n25 \n \nrepresentative language (sentence processing) task and a spatial (mental folding) task, \nand calculated the subject-level pairwise similarity among tasks to statistically compare \nintra-LMS similarity with LMS-spatial and LMS-language similarity. This reanalysis \nof previously reported data (Xu et al., 2021) was however distinct from previous \nanalyses in the research question, the methodology, the anatomical scope, and the range \nof tasks included. The previous analysis was conducted within the cortical regions \nactivated by mental programming and broke up the regions in question via clustering \nanalysis based on neural resemblance to a set of non-verbal tasks, while the present \nstudy conducted ROI-wise multivariate pattern similarity analysis to compare the \nrelative resemblance of LMS tasks with language and spatial tasks, which could not be \npredicted by the findings of the previous study. \nThough our analysis centered on LMS processing, we indeed speculate that spatial \ncognition might be a key cognitive cornerstone extending far beyond LMS processing, \npotentially influencing a wide array of cognitive abilities. Theories like the mental \nmodel (Johnson-Laird, 2001) and mental simulation (Barsalou, 2008; Hawes & Ansari, \n2020) suggest that relation processing typically utilizes a visuospatial workspace or \nsimulations to navigate representational spaces, and map-like representations are \nproposed to be a universal coding mechanism that organizes spatial, non-spatial, and \neven abstract information, using shared neural substrates (Behrens et al., 2018; Igarashi \net al., 2022; Theves et al., 2019). For example, the inferior parietal cortex, also \nidentified in this study, is known to encode non-spatial abstract information  (Crittenden \net al., 2016; Gottlieb & Snyder, 2010; Ikutani, Kubo, et al., 2021; Pischedda et al., 2017; \n26 \n \nSrikant et al., 2022; Viswanathan & Nieder, 2020; Woolgar et al., 2011) in addition to \nspatial information. This suggests a shared neural basis for spatial and non-spatial \ninformation mapping. Indeed, the spatial navigation system has been proposed to \nprovide critical computational components for the neural implementation of the \n“language of thought” (LoT) (Frankland & Greene, 2020; Kazanina & Poeppel, 2023). \nLoT, advanced by Jerry Fodor (1975), describes not an actual language but a formal \nsymbol system that stores and manipulates concepts symbolically, adhering to \ncompositional rules. This system enables the construction of complex thoughts from \nprimitive symbolic concepts and thus gives rise to the productivity and creativity of the \nhuman mind, advocating LoT as a candidate for human singularity in cognition \n(Dehaene et al., 2022; Sablé-Meyer et al., 2021).  \nHowever, the proposal that spatial cognition serves as a cross-domain \ncomputational foundation in the human mind leads to a puzzle: why does spatial \ncognition, an ability shared with many species, uniquely generate sophisticated non-\nspatial abilities in humans, such as formal operations of LMS systems? One possible \nanswer is that spatial cognition may not be the exclusive origin of LMS processing. \nLanguage processing, although not the primary source, may also contribute to LMS \nprocessing (Dowker et al., 2008; Ikutani, Itoh, et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020). Our \nstudy relies predominantly on anatomical overlaps in activation maps. This can result \nin an oversight of functional similarities between different anatomical regions. \nAccording to the multiple parallel circuit hypothesis (Dehaene et al., 2022), \nanatomically separate regions may instead undertake similar functionalities in different \n27 \n \nsymbol systems, which were all based on the recursive composition of corresponding \nprimitives to encode nested repetitions with variations. Thus, future studies should \nexplore the potential computational commonalities between language and LMS \nprocessing to further understand these intricate cognitive interactions. \nAnother limitation of our study is its reliance on correlational evidence, instead of \nestablishing a causal link between LMS processing and spatial cognition. Recent \nadvancements in large language models (LLM) may offer a novel avenue for \nexperimentation on this topic. By “re-running” evolution, we can observe how spatial \ncognition scaffolds the emergence of LMS processing during the evolution. Supporting \nthis intuition, state-of-the-art LLMs, proficient in natural language tasks, show brittle \nperformance in LMS tasks (Frieder et al., 2023; H. Liu et al., 2023). Wong et al. (2023) \nsuggested that this might be because LLMs work upon the context-aware mapping \nbetween language and meanings, lacking a world model based on probabilistic LoT. \nBased on the link between LMS processing and spatial cognition observed in this study, \nit could be worth investigating the enhancement of LMS processing in LLMs through \ntraining on spatial cognition tasks, such as path integrating, orienting, and map reading. \nIndeed, recent studies have demonstrated training navigation in abstract concept space \nusing cognitive maps could improve the reasoning and problem-solving ability of \nLLMs (Stöckl et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2023). Extending such investigation to training \nspatial cognition and endowing LLMs with spatial abilities might bridge the gap \nbetween disembodied information in LLM training and embodied reality that artificial \ngeneral intelligence (AGI) ultimately aims to interact with, which could significantly \n28 \n \ncontribute to the development of next-generation AGI.  \n \n4. Methods  \n4.1. Meta-analyses of language processing and spatial cognition \nWe generated meta-analysis activation maps based on large-scale automated meta-\nanalyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for language processing and \nspatial cognition. \n4.1.1. Meta-analysis of language processing \nTo generate a map of the neural correlates of language processing, we queried the \nNeurosynth (Yarkoni et al., 2011) database (version 0.5 released on February 23, 2015) \nusing the term “language” (accessed on 2023.8.19). This yielded a collection of 823 \nfMRI studies that exhibited significant relevance to the term with the default frequency \nthreshold of 0.001. Based on the coordinate-based meta-analysis technique of \nNeurosynth, we generated the map of brain regions that were preferentially engaged \nacross the selected studies. Each voxel within the resulting map was labeled by the z-\nscore resulting from a two-way ANOVA assessing the concomitant presence of term \nloading and voxel activation. The map was further corrected for multiple comparisons \nemploying the false discovery rate (FDR) approach with an anticipated FDR threshold \nof 0.01. \n29 \n \n4.1.2. Meta-analysis of spatial cognition \nAs for spatial cognition, there are no uniform terms to search in Neurosynth. Therefore, \nwe used the BrainMap database to generate the meta-analysis map of spatial cognition. \nFollowing the taxonomy outlined by Fox et al. (2005), we curated the experiments \ncategorized under the Behavioral Domain “Cognition.Spatial” in the BrainMap \nfunctional database (accessed by Sleuth 3.0.4 in 2023.8.19), under the constraint of \n“activations only”. This curation yielded 251 experimental contrasts from 63 relevant \npublications. The meta-analysis based on the experimental contrasts was implemented \nby the activation likelihood estimation (ALE), with BrainMap’s GingerALE tool. Same \nas the language processing analysis, we applied FDR correction (at  p = 0.01) to the \nresulting z-score map, adhering to the default GingerALE settings. \n \n4.2. fMRI studies \nThe present study used fMRI data from a separate sample of participants to estimate \nthe neural correlates of a set of representative LMS processing tasks, in addition to a \nrepresentative language processing task and a representative spatial cognition task. \nAnalyses based on these data for a different purpose have been reported in a previous \nstudy (Xu et al., 2021). \n4.2.1. Participants \n \nTwenty participants (right-handed neurologically normal volunteers with normal \nor corrected-to-normal vision) completed the experiment. The participants were \n30 \n \nscreened before recruitment to ensure they either had taken programming-related \ncourses or had experience in programming. The targeted sample size (20 valid \nparticipants) was decided a priori, to be similar to previous studies using similar tasks \n(e.g., Fedorenko et al.(2012), n = 13-16; Zhou et al.(2018), n = 24; Amalric & \nDehaene(2016), n = 15). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of \nBNU. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before they took \npart in the experiment, and the participants received money for their time.  \nFor a full description of the fMRI data acquisition, see Xu et al. (2021). For each \nparticipant, the fMRI data of three LMS processing tasks, one language processing task, \nand one spatial cognition task were recorded and analyzed in the present study. \n4.2.2. Experimental paradigms \nLMS processing. BOLD signals during three representative LMS processing tasks, \nnamely mental programming, reasoning, and calculation, were collected. \nThe mental programming task engaged participants in mentally solving simple \nprogramming problems, with reporting familiarity with knowledge entries as the \ncontrol condition. The programming problems were presented in Chinese as a one-to-\nthree-line introductory statement, a programming probe (“Please design a program \nwith:”), a one-line statement specifying the potential input, and a one-line statement \ndescribing the desired output. The knowledge entries in the control condition were \nmatched with the materials of the programming condition in length, format, and the use \nof symbols. Each entry started with a one-to-three-line introductory statement, followed \nby a brief conjunctive clause (e.g., “in other words”), and two one-to-two-line \n31 \n \nelaborations of the concept introduced in the introductory statement. The mental \nprogramming trials started with a programming task probe presenting “report progress”, \nand the participants were to read and consider the programming problem, and wait for \nthe response prompt to choose from a four-point scale to report their progress in \nprogramming. The participants were instructed before the scanning that for \nprogramming they should consider the algorithm instead of specific code, and the \nsolution of the problem means finding the algorithm instead of finishing the coding. \nThe control trials started with the control task probe which read “report familiarity”, \nand participants were to read and consider whether they were familiar with the content \nof the knowledge entry and choose from a four-point scale to report their familiarity \nwith the content. The mental programming task was divided into six runs, each \nconsisting of four trials in the mental programming condition and four in the control \ncondition. \nThe reasoning task comprised a reasoning condition adopted from Raven’s APM \nand a control condition. In both conditions, the participants first saw a problem with a \ncomplex main figure, with eight choices below. The problems of the reasoning trials \nwere chosen from Raven’s APM, and those of the control condition were composed by \nrearranging the choices of other Raven’s APM items in the main figure and the choices \nin each problem. Above each problem, a task probe would indicate whether it is a \nreasoning trial (“Look for the rule”) or a control trial (“Look for the choices”). The \nparticipants were to consider which choice complies with the rule of figure arrangement \nand completes the main pattern (the reasoning condition), or to consider which choice \n32 \n \nwas presented in the main pattern (the control condition). Each participant completed \nfive functional runs consisting of eight trials each. \nThe calculation task was adopted from Fedorenko et al. (2010) with an additional \ncontrol condition. In the calculation trials, the participants would first see a task probe \n(“Do the addition”) and then see one number (11–30) followed by three sequentially \npresented addends. Then the participants had to choose the correct sum in a two-choice, \nforced-choice question. In the control trials, after the task probe (“Memorize the \nnumbers”) and the same sequential presentation of four numbers, the participants were \nto select, from two alternatives, the one among the four preceding numbers. Each \nparticipant completed four runs which each consisted of six calculation blocks and six \ncontrol blocks.  \n \nLanguage processing and spatial cognition.  \nThe sentence processing task was used as the representative language processing \ntask. It was adopted from Fedorenko et al. (2010) but used sentences and pseudo-\ncharacters in Mandarin Chinese. Each experimental trial consisted of a sequential \npresentation of a string of seven Chinese real words which formed one sentence \nfollowed by a target word. The task was to decide whether the target word appeared in \nthe preceding string. In control trials, the Chinese characters were replaced by pseudo-\ncharacters. The trials were grouped into six-trial blocks. Each participant underwent \nfour block-design runs, each consisting of three experimental blocks and three control \nblocks.  \n33 \n \nSpatial cognition was measured in a mental folding task adopted from Milivojevic \net al. (2003). In each trial, the participants were shown a black outline of six squares \njoined together, representing the unfolded surface of a cube. Two sides belonging to \ndifferent squares (mental folding condition) or the same square (control condition) were \npointed by two small arrows. In the “match” trials, the pointed sides would meet if the \nsquares were folded up into a cube. Trials in the mental folding and the control \nconditions differed in the total number of squares carried along for each fold for the \nmatch–mismatch decision to be made. The control trials presented 1-square-carried \nstimuli since the judgment of such stimuli can be made without mental folding. Every \nfour trials of the same condition were grouped into a block. Each participant completed \nfive or six block-design functional runs. Note that the first three participants completed \nsix runs, and the rest participants underwent only five runs due to the limitation of the \nscanning time. \nFor a complete description of the experimental paradigms, see Xu et al. (2021). \n \n4.2.3. fMRI data acquisition and analysis \nImage acquisition. The fMRI data were acquired using a Siemens 3T scanner with a \n12-channel phased-array head coil. Task-state fMRI (ts-fMRI) was acquired using a T2\n∗-weighted echo-planar-imaging (EPI) sequence with a whole-brain protocol (TR = \n2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90◦, and in-plane resolution = 3.1 × 3.1 × 3.5 mm, \n33 contiguous interleaved slices). For a complete description of the imaging parameters, \nsee Xu et al. (2021). \n34 \n \n \nPreprocessing. The functional data were preprocessed with DPABI (Yan et al., 2016). \nThe main preprocessing procedure included slice timing, head motion correction, co-\nregistration, segmentation, spatial normalization to the standard MNI space, and \nresampling to 3 × 3 × 3 mm isotropic voxels. The data were smoothed with a 4 mm \nFWHM kernel for univariate activation analysis. Smoothing was omitted for \nmultivariate activation analysis. Runs characterized by excessive head movement were \nexcluded from further analysis. \n \nUnivariate analyses. First-level analyses were performed for functional images of each \nparticipant in each task using the general linear model (GLM). The GLM incorporated \nregressors corresponding to the following events: the task condition, the control \ncondition, and the presence of the response prompt and task probe. The regressors were \nconvolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF). A 1/128 Hz high-\npass filter was applied to remove low-frequency noise, with the AR (1) model used to \naccount for serial correlations. For each experiment, subject-level and group-level \nanalyses were conducted within a gray matter mask by SPM8 (Wellcome Department \nof Imaging Neuroscience, London; www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). The subject-level map \ncorresponded to the contrasts of parameter estimates (COPE) between the respective \ntask versus the control condition of each subject. The group-level map was estimated \nin the second-level analysis of the corresponding task-control contrasts. \n \n35 \n \n4.2.4. Conjunctive analysis of LMS processing \nTo estimate the neural correlates across diverse LMS processing tasks, we generated a \nsynthesized activation map of LMS processing based on the data of the three \nrepresentative LMS tasks, i.e., reasoning, calculation, and mental programming tasks \ndescribed above. We utilized Stouffer’s method in the image-based meta-analysis. The \nunthresholded group-level maps of each LMS processing task were subjected to \nStouffer’s estimator using the NiMARE Python package version 0.0.13 (Salo et al., \n2023). The estimator combined the group-level maps via Stouffer’s method (Stouffer \net al., 1949) and produced a fixed-effect estimate of the combined effect, to obtain the \nmost sensitive pooling of the studies. Each voxel within the resultant synthesized map \nconveyed a third-level COPE, indicating the pooled activation across LMS processing \ntasks. The synthesized map was corrected with an expected FDR of 0.01. \n \n4.3. Dice coefficients of meta-analysis maps and subject-level maps \nTo quantify the extent of overlap between LMS processing and language processing \nand that between LMS processing and spatial cognition, we computed dice coefficients \nbetween the activation maps for each pair, which was an index of the convergence \nbetween activation maps. For a given pair of maps, the dice coefficient was determined \nas the ratio between twice the count of shared voxels and the sum of voxels in both \nmaps. The dice coefficients were calculated between the thresholded meta-analysis map \nof language processing and the thresholded synthesized map of LMS processing, and \n36 \n \nbetween spatial cognition and LMS processing. In addition, for statistical comparison, \ncorresponding dice coefficients were calculated for each subject based on the \ncorresponding subject-level maps (thresholded by a voxel-level threshold at  p = 0.001).  \n \n4.4. Multivariate pattern analysis \nTo compare the multivariate pattern similarity between LMS processing and those \nassociated with language processing and spatial cognition, we conducted multivariate \npattern analysis in an ROI-based manner. The region of interest (ROI) was defined as \nthe common activation region between the meta-analysis maps of language processing \nand spatial cognition.  \nThe comparison of multivariate activation pattern similarity was quantified by the \nconfusion rate in multivariate activation pattern classification. Specifically, we trained \na classifier for each subject to classify the multivariate activation pattern in the run-\nlevel beta map of the sentence processing task from that of the mental folding task. The \nrun-level beta map (task versus fixation) was based on the GLM using non-smoothed \ndata. The classifier was based on the support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel \nimplemented by The Decoding Toolbox (TDT) (Hebart et al., 2015), and trained with \nthe leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to prevent overfitting. In each cross-\nvalidation step, one SVM was trained by three runs of sentence processing task and \nthree runs of mental rotation task separated from one run of each task kept unknown. \nThen in the test session, the SVM would classify the left-out run from each training \n37 \n \ntask for performance validation (indicated as accuracy). For quantitative balance, all \ntasks included the first four runs in a set. Note that the outcome appeared consistent \nregardless of which specific four runs were chosen in the examination. The LOOCV \ntraversed all combinations of left-out runs and resulted in an averaged classifier of each \nparticipant. The classifier achieved an accuracy of nearly 100% in distinguishing the \ntwo tasks across 20 participants. In the test session, each run of LMS processing tasks \nwas classified by the SVM into one of the training tasks. The confusion rate at which \nLMS processing was (mis)classified as a given training task quantified the pattern \nresemblance between the LMS processing task and the corresponding training task.  \nTo test the relationship between LMS processing and spatial cognition, we \ncalculated the intra-LMS similarity, LMS-spatial similarities, and LMS-language \nsimilarity based on the same run-level beta maps in the ROI. For each participant, the \nmultivariate pattern for a representative task was represented as a one-dimensional \nvector concatenated sequentially from the first four runs’ vectors. The pairwise \nmultivariate pattern similarities were calculated using Spearman's r for all \ncorresponding combinations of two tasks for each participant and statistically tested at \nthe group level.  \nTo further investigate the hierarchical multivariate pattern similarity between LMS \nprocessing and spatial cognition, agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis was \nconducted on the multivariate patterns of the tasks, based on the same run-level beta \nmaps in the ROI. For each representative task, the multivariate pattern was a one-\ndimensional vector formed by concatenating the multivariate pattern from each \n38 \n \nparticipant. The clustering analysis was conducted with the nearest point algorithm \nimplemented by the SciPy Python package version 1.5.4 (Virtanen et al., 2020).   \n5.
