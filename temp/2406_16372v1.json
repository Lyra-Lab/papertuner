Although exist-\ning cross-lingual works (Li et al., 2023; Clouâtre\net al., 2022) share explicit language semantics\nacross different languages, they generally rely on\nsupervised parallel corpora and simple, shallow\nunsupervised mechanisms such as back transla-\ntion (Lam et al., 2022; Nishikawa et al., 2021) and\nrandom deletion (Sun et al., 2022).\nThe previous data augmentation (DA) ap-\nproaches in cross-lingual representation learning\ncan be roughly divided into two categories: super-\nvised parallel data augmenters and unsupervised\nWork done when Dongyang Li was doing an intern-\nship at Alibaba Group.

Supervised Parallel Data Augmenter: These\nworks (Fernando et al., 2023; Lai et al., 2022;\nRiabi et al., 2021) utilize annotated parallel\ncorpora (e.g., bilingual dictionaries and trans-\nlation tools) to augment the training data by\naligning the same meanings across different\nlanguages for low-resource tasks. However,\nthe collection process for these parallel cor-\npora is time-consuming and relies on human\nannotation.\n2. Unsupervised Shallow Data Augmenter: Un-\nlike the supervised approaches mentioned\nabove, these methods employ unsupervised\neasy data augmentation (EDA) techniques\n(e.g., back translation, random deletion, and\nrandom replacement) to generate additional\ntraining samples for model training (Nishikawa\net al., 2021; Bari et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021).\nThese methods focus solely on the surface se-\nmantics of the input samples to match cross-\nlingual data without considering the deeper\nlinguistic connections.\nAs shown in Figure 1, techniques like “random dele-\ntion” and “random replacement” may alter the sen-\ntence’s intended meaning. Hence, we aim to ex-\npand the multilingual training samples based on a\narXiv:2406.16372v1  [cs.CL]  24 Jun 2024\nApple Computer Inc introduced two PC-\ncompatible …with the Windows software.\nApple Computer Inc introduced\ntwo PC-compatible computers that \nhave compatibility with the \nWindows software.\nE\nF\nParallel\nCorpora\nSupervised\nI prefer the morning flight.\nI prefer the early flight.\nJe préfère le vol du matin.\nℎ1\nℎ4\n𝒉𝒋\n𝒉𝟑\n𝒉𝟐\nLanguage Family\nCluster\nApple Computer Inc eingeführt\ntwo PC-compatible คอมพิวเตอร์that \nhave совместимость with the \nWindows software.\nBilingual\nDictionary\n. . .\n…\nℎ𝑙\nℎ1\nℎ4\n𝒉𝒋\n′\n𝒉𝟑\n′\n𝒉𝟐\n′\n. . .\n…\nℎ𝑙\nBack Translation\nRandom Deletion\n\nRandom Replacement\nYou prefer the evening flight.\nShallow Semantic\nDeep Semantic\nI prefer the morning flight.\nFrench\nEnglish\nEnglish\nEnglish\nEnglish\nEnglish\nEnglish\nEnglish\nUnsupervised\nPLMs\nFigure 1: Examples of previous data augmentation techniques, including supervised methods that rely on\nparallel data, and unsupervised methods which carry the risk of losing sentential semantic coherence.\ndeep semantic understanding that the model can\nautomatically derive, such as from the hidden lay-\ners of a pre-trained language model (PLM).\nTo overcome the issues mentioned above,\nwe propose an Unsupervised Pseudo Semantic\nData Augmentation (UniPSDA) mechanism, which\nmainly consists of two modules:\n• Domino Unsupervised Cluster: To provide\nhigh-quality multilingual representations for\nperforming the subsequent deep unsupervised\ndata augmentation, we group languages into\na hierarchical structure organized by language\nfamilies1 to learn multilingual relations. We\nperform the clustering process via the domino\nchain process2 to collect semantically similar\nwords across different languages by compar-\ning the embeddings themselves, a method we\nname Domino Unsupervised Cluster. Specifi-\ncally, the domino cluster is a chain-rule process\ncomprised of three different sequential stages:\nthe single language stage, the language family\nstage, and the multi-language stage.\n• Pseudo Semantic Data Augmentation: Con-\nsidering that previous data augmentation meth-\nods focus on the surface of naive training sam-\nples, we employ the learned multilingual inter-\nnal representations to address the semantic\ndeficiencies of the training samples. Specif-\nically, the domino clustering-enhanced ulti-\nmate multilingual representations directly re-\nplace the important positions’ hidden states\nin training samples, as recognized by the\n<subject,verb,object> (SVO) structure. The\npotential incompatibility phenomena of insert-\ning clustering multilingual representations may\n1https://www.ethnologue.com/browse/families\n2https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_effect\nresult in biased parameter learning. To fur-\nther alleviate the misalignment between the\nreplaced embeddings space and the context\noutput space of PLMs, we introduce three de-\nbiasing optimal transport affinity regularization\ntechniques to make the learning process faster\nand more stable.\n2.\nMethodology\n2.1.\nModel Notations\nThe architecture of UniPSDA is shown in Figure 2.\nThe goal of cross-lingual natural language under-\nstanding is to utilize a source language dataset\nDlang = (Xlang, Ylang) to train a model M. Then\nwe apply the trained model M to tasks in other\ntarget languages Dlang′ = (Xlang′, Ylang′), where X\ndenotes the input samples and Y is the label set.\nIn our work, each sentence of the training data\nis denoted as Si = (wi1, wi2, · · · , wij, · · · , wili),\nwhere wij denotes the j-th word in sentence Si\nand li is the maximum word count of the sentence.\nThe hidden state of word wij is hwij ∈R|u|×d,\nwhere |u| is the maximum number of tokens con-\ntained in the word and d is the dimension of the\nhidden state. The hidden state of sentence Si is\nhsi ∈R|Ls|×d, where |Ls| is the sentence’s maxi-\nmum token length. The specific notations for the\nthree clustering stages in the Domino Unsupervised\nCluster are as follows:\n• In the single language stage, the words in the\nm-th single language GSinm are clustered into\n|GSinm| clusters. The t-th cluster is denoted as\nClusin\nmt.\n• In the language family stage, the words in the\nn-th language family GFamn are clustered into\n𝜶𝟏\n𝜶𝟐\n𝜶𝟑\n𝜶𝟒\n𝜷𝟏\n𝜷𝟐\nSemantic Info.\nm-BERT\nUD\nGMM\nLang.

All the words in\nGMul are clustered into |GMul| clusters. The q-th\ncluster is denoted as Clumul\nq\n.\n2.2.\nText Encoder\nIn this paper, m-BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) is utilized\nas our encoder3 to obtain the hidden states, which\nare averaged from the embeddings of the first and\nlast layers. The final hidden state of the j-th word\nin sentence Si is formulated as:\nhwij = 1\n2 (Ffirst (wij) + Flast (wij))\n(1)\nwhere Ffirst and Flast denote the representations\nfrom the first and last layers, respectively. We aver-\nage these representations to obtain the sentence’s\nhidden state hsi.\n3Other multilingual pre-trained language models can\nalso be considered as the backbone.\n2.3.\nDomino Unsupervised Cluster\nTo enable the model to learn relevant word infor-\nmation corresponding to different languages, we\nperform three hierarchical, chain-rule-based clus-\ntering steps, sequentially applied to representations\nof varying language granularities.\n2.3.1.\nSingle Language Cluster\nIn the single language cluster stage, we aim to\ngroup similar words within a specific language. To\nrefine the clustering process, we clarify that “simi-\nlar words” refers not only to semantic similarity but\nalso to the concordance of part-of-speech (POS)\ntags. For instance, verbs with the meaning of “hope”\nare grouped together, distinct from nouns with sim-\nilar meanings, thereby incorporating lexical POS\nknowledge into the clustering. Initially, we employ\nthe Universal Dependencies4-based PyTorch tool\nStanza5, to obtain the POS tag for each word. The\ntraining data contains 17 types of POS tags, and we\nrepresent each word with a 17-dimensional one-hot\n4https://universaldependencies.org/\n5Stanza is an off-the-shelf cross-lingual linguistic anal-\nysis package. URL: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/\nstanza/\nvector vPOS to signify the initial tag representations.\nThis one-hot vector is then mapped to a context-\naware space by a linear function (WPOSvPOS + bPOS).\nThe final embeddings hfinal\nwij are obtained by con-\ncatenating the original word representations with\nthe projected POS tags:\nhfinal\nwij = [hwij || (W\nPOS v\nPOS + b\nPOS )]\n(2)\nwhere “||” denotes the concatenation operation.\nWords with similar final embeddings are clustered\ntogether using an expectation-maximization algo-\nrithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).\nFor the m-th language, we obtain |GSinm| clusters\nat the end of the clustering process:\nClusin\nm1, Clusin\nm2, . . . , Clusin\nm|GSinm | = GMM(\nhw1, hw2, . . . , hw|GSinm |)\n(3)\nwhere |GSinm| is the total number of words in the\nm-th language.\n2.3.2.\nLanguage Family Cluster\nIn the Ethnologue6 linguistic categorical tree, each\nlanguage is considered a leaf node. Language\nfamilies serve as ancestor nodes within this tree\nstructure, and all descendant nodes of a particu-\nlar ancestor node are grouped into the same lan-\nguage family. We aggregate the results of single\nlanguage clusters within a specific language fam-\nily and calculate the expert weight αmt for each\ncluster using a Gate mechanism (Li et al., 2018).\nThis weight is determined by the proportion of each\ncluster’s word count in relation to the total sam-\nple size. In essence, we incorporate the size in-\nformation of each cluster into the clustering pro-\ncess. The single language stage involves a total\nof Nsin = |Clusin\nm1| + |Clusin\nm2| + · · · + |Clusin\nm|GSinm||\nelements, where |Clusin\nm1| denotes the number of\nelements in cluster Clusin\nm1. Thus, the expert weight\nfor the t-th cluster αmt of language GSinm is de-\nfined as αmt = |Clusin\nmt|\nNsin\n. We represent all expert\nweights across r languages of the n-th language\nfamily GFamn as the matrix Asin. The cluster-center\nembeddings of single language clusters, denoted\nas Censin\nmt, are used in the language family cluster\nstage. The expert-weighted cluster-center embed-\ndings hCensin\nmt ∈R|u|×d are then input into the GMM\nclustering process. The matrix Hsin comprises all\ncluster-center embeddings across r languages of\nthe n-th language family GFamn. GMM clustering\ngroups semantically similar words from r languages\ninto a specific cluster Clufam\nng .\nClufam\nn1 , Clufam\nn2 , . . . , Clufam\nn|GFamn| = GMM(\nele(Asin ⊙Hsin))\n(4)\n6https://www.ethnologue.com/\nwhere the Asin and Hsin matrices are defined as\nfollows:\nAsin =\n\n\nα11\nα12\n· · ·\nα1|GSin1|\nα21\nα22\n· · ·\nα2|GSin2|\n...\n...\n...\n...\nαr1\nαr2\n· · ·\nαr|GSinr |\n\n,\nHsin =\n\n\nhCensin\n11\nhCensin\n12\n· · ·\nhCensin\n1|GSin1 |\nhCensin\n21\nhCensin\n22\n· · ·\nhCensin\n2|GSin2 |\n...\n...\n...\n...\nhCensin\nr1\nhCensin\nr2\n· · ·\nhCensin\nr|GSinr |\n\n\n(5)\nwhere ele() denotes the operation of enumerating\nevery element of the matrix, and ⊙represents the\nelement-wise product.\n2.3.3.\nMulti Languages Cluster\nFinally, we perform clustering on all language family\ncluster-center embeddings obtained from the lan-\nguage family cluster stage. For example, the first\ncluster-center of cluster Clufam\nn1 in the n-th language\nfamily is denoted as Cenfam\nn1 . Each cluster-center\nembedding is associated with a multi-language ex-\npert weight βng, computed using the same Gate\nmechanism as in the language family cluster stage.\nWe represent all expert-weight elements across z\nlanguage families of the multi-language pool GMul\nas the matrix Bfam. These expert-weighted cluster-\ncenter embeddings hCenfam\nng ∈R|u|×d are then used\nin the GMM clustering process. The matrix Hfam\ncontains all cluster-center embeddings across the z\nlanguage families of GMul. GMM clustering groups\nsemantically similar words from the z language fam-\nilies into specific clusters, denoted as Clumul\nq\n.\nClumul\n1 , Clumul\n2 , . . . , Clumul\n|GMul| = GMM(\nele(Bfam ⊙Hfam))\n(6)\nwhere the matrices Bfam and Hfam are defined as\nfollows:\nBfam =\n\n\nβ11\nβ12\n· · ·\nβ1|GSin1|\nβ21\nβ22\n· · ·\nβ2|GSin2|\n...\n...\n...\n...\nβz1\nβz2\n· · ·\nβz|GSinz |\n\n,\nHfam =\n\n\nhCenfam\n11\nhCenfam\n12\n· · ·\nhCenfam\n1|GFam1 |\nhCenfam\n21\nhCenfam\n22\n· · ·\nhCenfam\n2|GFam2 |\n...\n...\n...\n...\nhCenfam\nz1\nhCenfam\nz2\n· · ·\nhCenfam\nz|GFamz |\n\n\n(7)\nwhere ele() denotes the operation of enumerating\neach element of the matrix, and ⊙represents the\nelement-wise product.\n2.4.\nPseudo Semantic Data\nAugmentation\nTo enrich the training data with diverse linguistic\ninformation, we augment the model with global mul-\ntilingual semantics obtained from the last domino\nunsupervised cluster module.\n2.4.1.\nPseudo Semantic Replacement\nWe propose two approaches for handling sentence\nsemantics. First, we pass sentences through m-\nBERT to generate embeddings for each sentence.\nSecond, we use Universal Dependencies to extract\nsyntactic parsing trees for the sentences. To guide\nthe model toward learning more accurate repre-\nsentations of crucial sentence words, we focus on\nkey elements identified through syntactic parsing.\nGiven that the subject, verb, and object (SVO) com-\nponents are essential for comprehension in many\ntasks (Dai et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017), we treat\nthe SVO as the crucial words of each sentence.\nSubsequently, we mark the position of each SVO\ncomponent within the sentence:\nhsi = [eti1, eti2, . . . , ewiS, . . . ,\newiV , . . . , ewiO, . . . , eti|Ls|]\n(8)\nwhere ewiS, ewiV , and ewiO denote the embeddings\nof the sentence’s subject, verb, and object compo-\nnents, respectively, and eti1 represents the embed-\nding of the first token in sentence Si. We replace\nthe original sentence’s SVO word embeddings with\nrandomly selected candidate embeddings from the\nsame cluster. These candidate word embeddings\nshare similar semantics with the SVO words but\ncome from different languages. Through the re-\nplacement of crucial words with cross-lingual knowl-\nedge, we can guide the model to learn more about\nthe critical linguistic elements of sentences and\nachieve better semantic representations. The up-\ndated sentence representation is expressed as:\nh\n′\nsi = [eti1, eti2, . . . , ecan′\niS, . . . ,\necan′\niV , . . . , ecan′\niO, . . . , eti|Ls|]\n(9)\nwhere ecan′\niS, ecan′\niV , and ecan′\niO denote the candi-\ndate embeddings for the subject, verb, and object\ncomponents, respectively. After the embedding\nreplacement, cross-lingual pseudo semantic infor-\nmation is introduced to the training data. We then\nfeed these enhanced representations into trans-\nformer models with base-level parameter sizes to\nrefine the embeddings.\n2.4.2.\nDe-biasing Optimal Transport Affinity\nRegularization\nSpatial misalignment exists between the original\nsentence and the enhanced sentence, as noted\nby (Huang et al., 2022b). To diminish the discrep-\nancy between the replaced sentence embedding\nh\n′\nsi and the original sentence embedding hsi, we in-\ntroduce an integrated regularization term based on\nthe optimal transport mechanism, named Optimal\nTransport Affinity Regularization.\n(1) Wasserstein Distance Abbreviation: To\nalign the space of original sentence representations\nwith that of cross-lingual knowledge-enhanced sen-\ntence representations (Wang and Henao, 2022;\nAlqahtani et al., 2021), we employ optimal trans-\nport (OT ) to facilitate the adjustment process. We\ncalculate a transport plan P that maps the original\nsentence to the augmented sentence with optimal\ncost C ∈R|Ls|×|Ls|, using the Euclidean distance\n(Danielsson, 1980) between the two sentence rep-\nresentations as a measure of cost:\nC(hsi, h\n′\nsi) =\n d\nX\nj=1\n\f\f\fhsij −h\n′\nsij\n\f\f\f\n2\n! 1\n2\n(10)\nWe aim to find the optimal transport plan P ∈\nR|Ls|×|Ls| that minimizes the cost C. This prob-\nlem is formulated as minimizing the p-Wasserstein\ndistance dp−W ass. Due to the high computational\ncomplexity of calculating P, we approximate it using\nthe Sinkhorn algorithm (Altschuler et al., 2017):\nK = exp\n \n−C(hsi, h\n′\nsi)\nε\n!\n(11)\nP(hsi, h\n′\nsi) = diag(u)Kdiag(v)\n(12)\nWe compute u and v iteratively, starting with v(0) =\n1|Ls|, using the following update formulas:\nu(l+1) = a(hsi)\nKv(l) ,\nv(l+1) =\nb(h\n′\nsi)\nKT u(l+1)\n(13)\nwhere a and b are distribution mapping functions.\nThe OT loss can be defined as:\nlossOT = ⟨P(hsi, h\n′\nsi), C(hsi, h\n′\nsi)⟩\n(14)\nTo mitigate the OT learning biases between the\ntwo sentence representations, we introduce two\nauxiliary de-biasing terms to calibrate the loss.\n(2) De-biasing Eigenvectors Shrinkage: We\nutilize a linear orthogonal mapping parameter W ∈\nR|Ls|×|Ls| to approximate the replaced embeddings\nto the original ones, hsi ≈Wh\n′\nsi. Singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) is directly applied to compute\nW (Xing et al., 2015):\nUΣVT = SVD(h\n′T\nsi hsi)\n(15)\nW = VUT\n(16)\nWe initialize the linear mapping function with weight\nW to simplify the learning process. However, eigen-\nvectors with small singular values can lead to poor\ntransformations if not suppressed (Chen et al.,\n2019). Thus, we penalize the smallest k singular\nvalues of Σ, which is ordered by magnitude. The\neigenvectors shrinkage loss is defined as:\nlosseig = −η\nk\nX\nr=1\nσ2\nr\n(17)\nwhere η is a hyper-parameter to control the degree\nof penalty, and σr is the r-th smallest singular value.\n(3) De-biasing Distance Shrinkage: To guide\nthe framework’s learning direction towards minimiz-\ning the discrepancy, we add a term based on the\ndistance between the two embeddings to the loss\nfunction. The distance shrinkage loss is defined\nas:\nlossdis = 1 −sim(hsi, h\n′\nsi)\n(18)\nwhere sim() represents the similarity measure.\nFinally, the auxiliary OT affinity regularization is\ngiven by:\nlossReg = ρ1lossOT + ρ2losseig + ρ3lossdis (19)\nwhere ρi denotes the controlled weight of each\nregularization component, with the constraint that\nthe sum of ρi equals 1.\n2.5.\nTraining Objective\nOur training objective combines the task-specific\nloss with the OT affinity regularization. The overall\nobjective function is formulated as:\nlosstotal = λ1losstask + λ2lossReg\n(20)\nwhere λi controls the relative contribution of each\ncomponent, and the sum of λi is constrained to be\n1.\n3.\nExperiments\n3.1.\nTasks and Datasets\nSequence Classification tasks include text classi-\nfication and sentiment analysis. We selected the fol-\nlowing datasets for these tasks: MLDoc (Schwenk\nand Li, 2018) for text classification, and the Multi-\nBooked Catalan and Basque (Barnes et al., 2018)7\nfor sentiment analysis. The evaluation metrics for\nthese tasks are accuracy and macro F1.\nFor Information Extraction, we focus on Rela-\ntion Extraction as a representative task. Here, the\ngoal is to predict the correct relation type present\nin the data. We use the ACE2005 dataset (Walker\net al., 2006), which spans three languages: En-\nglish, Chinese, and Arabic. The performance is\nmeasured using micro F1.\n7We refer to these datasets collectively by the term\n“OpeNER”.\nQuestion Answering involves retrieving an-\nswers for specific questions from a given passage.\nWe conduct experiments on the cross-lingual ques-\ntion answering dataset BiPaR (Jing et al., 2019),\nwhich is commonly used for evaluating such sys-\ntems. The evaluation metrics for this task are Exact\nMatch (EM) and micro F1.\n3.2.\nExperiment Settings\nGiven computational resource constraints, we em-\nploy the base-level version of multilingual BERT\n(m-BERT) to obtain hidden states for words and\nsentences.\nThe encoder consists of 12 Trans-\nformer layers with 12 self-attention heads, and\nthe hidden state dimension is set to 768.\nDur-\ning training, we experiment with learning rates in\n{1e−5, 2e−5, 3e−5, 1e−6, 2e−6, 3e−6}. AdamW\nis chosen as the optimizer, with a learning rate of\n1e −3 and weight decay of 1e −5. For the Wasser-\nstein distance, we set p = 1, while the Sinkhorn\nalgorithm’s control parameter ε is 0.1.

(3) In\nthe sentiment analysis task, our UniPSDA model\nboosts the average macro F1 score to 86.0, as\nshown in Table 2.

(2) The enhanced focus on acquiring\npertinent cross-lingual knowledge regarding crucial\nsentence components has led to a solid average\nF1 score of approximately 44.1 in our experiments,\nmarking an improvement of 2.7.\nQuestion Answering: Table 4 presents the per-\nformance of our question answering framework.\nThe results suggest that: (1) Despite the zero-shot\nexperimental setup, the pseudo data augmentation\nModel\nen\nzh\nar\nAverage\nm-BERT\n57.1\n44.8\n21.5\n41.1(±0.5)\nXLM-R\n54.9\n45.2\n21.7\n40.6(±0.4)\nLaBSE\n55.1\n45.8\n26.6\n42.5(±0.2)\nHERBERTa\n54.5\n45.7\n26.4\n42.2(±0.3)\nCoSDA-ML\n58.3\n45.5\n20.4\n41.4(±0.5)\nDAP\n59.0\n46.2\n26.2\n43.8(±0.2)\nSOGOcos\n58.7\n46.2\n26.5\n43.8(±0.3)\nX-STA\n57.9\n45.7\n26.2\n43.3(±0.1)\nCCCAR\n56.6\n43.9\n18.3\n39.6(±0.3)\nUniPSDA\n59.1\n46.3\n26.8\n44.1(±0.1)\nTable 3: General experimental results of informa-\ntion extraction in terms of micro F1 (%) and base-\nlines on the ACE2005 dataset.\nModel\nen\nzh\nAverage\nEM\nF1\nEM\nF1\nm-BERT\n31.9\n44.3\n23.5\n26.1\n31.5(±0.6)\nXLM-R\n32.3\n45.0\n23.3\n26.2\n31.7(±0.3)\nLaBSE\n33.7\n43.4\n24.2\n25.7\n31.8(±0.5)\nCoSDA-ML\n34.2\n44.5\n24.7\n25.9\n32.3(±0.2)\nX-METRA-ADA\n33.9\n44.9\n23.8\n26.8\n32.4(±0.1)\nSSDM\n34.1\n45.8\n24.1\n26.2\n32.6(±0.2)\nDAP\n34.3\n45.9\n24.6\n27.1\n33.0(±0.3)\nSOGOcos\n34.2\n45.5\n24.7\n27.1\n32.9(±0.2)\nX-STA\n33.8\n44.9\n24.2\n26.7\n32.4(±0.2)\nUniPSDA\n34.4\n45.7\n25.0\n27.3\n33.1(±0.2)\nTable 4: General experimental results of question\nanswering and baselines on the BiPaR dataset.\nmechanism employed by our framework demon-\nstrates a robust transfer capability.

(2) The scores obtained\nin the two languages evaluated affirm the efficacy\nof UniPSDA. However, our F1 scores for English\nare lower than those achieved by SSDM (Wu et al.,\n2022) and DAP (Li et al., 2023). This discrepancy\ncan be attributed to the fact that SSDM and DAP\nutilize specific parallel data for training, which was\nnot the case in our approach.\n4.\nDetailed Analysis\n4.1.\nAblation Study\nIn our ablation study, we independently remove key\ncomponents—namely, the Domino Unsupervised\nCluster module and the Pseudo Semantic Data\nAugmentation module—to evaluate their individual\ncontributions to the framework’s performance. The\nresults of the ablation experiments are presented\nin Table 5. We draw two main conclusions: (1)\nThe Domino Unsupervised Cluster module is cru-\nModel\nOpeNER\nMLDoc\nACE05\nBiPaR\nUniPSDA\n86.0\n79.3\n44.1\n45.7\n-Dom. Unsup.\n85.8\n74.9\n41.9\n45.1\n-Pse.

(2)\nThe absence of the cluster module leads to a notice-\nable decline in performance across all downstream\ntasks. Specifically, in text classification, accuracy\nfalls by 4.4% (from 79.3% to 74.9%). This indicates\nthat clustering based on semantic embeddings is\nmore beneficial to the model than clustering based\non shallow string representations. The removal of\nthe Pseudo Semantic Data Augmentation module\nalso results in a marked decrease in performance\ndue to the lack of cross-lingual knowledge.\n4.2.\nInfluence of Domino Unsupervised\nCluster\nWe employ t-SNE (van der Maaten and Hinton,\n2008) to project the high-dimensional word repre-\nsentations into a two-dimensional space, facilitating\nthe visualization of the embeddings. The result-\ning plots compare word embeddings clustered by\nthe Domino Unsupervised Cluster and the naive\nK-Means algorithm. As depicted in Figure 3, the\ndomino unsupervised cluster gathers similar word\nembeddings more compactly, whereas the naive\nK-Means approach results in a more diffuse distri-\nbution of similar word embeddings.\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nepoch\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\nF1-Score\npseudo semantic repl.\nrandom word emb.\nrandom word str.\nFigure 4: Results comparison of different data aug-\nmentation skills in Pseudo Semantic Data Augmen-\ntation module.\n4.3.\nThe Influence of Pseudo Semantic\nData Augmentation\nTo examine the effect of Pseudo Semantic Data\nAugmentation on the information extraction task,\nwe experiment with three distinct replacement\nstrategies on the English test set. The comparative\nresults are illustrated in Figure 4.\nObservations indicate that replacements using\nrandom word strings or random word embeddings\nare less effective than those leveraging pseudo se-\nmantic methods. The pseudo semantic data aug-\nmentation approach demonstrates a superior abil-\nity to preserve the semantic integrity of sentences,\nleading to more meaningful augmentations and po-\ntentially better model performance.\n5.\nRelated Work\n5.1.\nCross-Lingual Pre-trained Models\nRecent cross-lingual pre-trained language models\n(PLMs) can be categorized into two groups:\n1. Monolingual Training Data Models: Multilin-\ngual BERT (m-BERT) (Devlin et al., 2019) and\nXLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) utilize mono-\nlingual corpora for training with a masked lan-\nguage modeling task.\n2. Multilingual Training Data Models: Exten-\nsions of XLM-R by Jiang et al. (2022); Häm-\nmerl et al. (2022); Chi et al. (2022); Barbi-\neri et al. (2022) demonstrate improvements\nwith high-quality static embedding alignments.\nTools facilitating bilingual language alignment\n(Tran et al., 2020; Chi et al., 2021; Yang et al.,\n2020a; Schuster et al., 2019) enable the learn-\ning of additional languages. These models\noften depend on parallel data and alignment\ntools to enrich the corpus diversity.\n5.2.\nCross-Lingual Data Augmentations\nCross-lingual data augmentation approaches are\ntypically divided into:\n1. Supervised Data Augmentation: Methods\nsuch as CoSDA-ML (Qin et al., 2020) and\nMulDA (Liu et al., 2021) utilize parallel cor-\npora to integrate knowledge from other lan-\nguages. Dong et al. (2021) employ parallel\nlanguage alignments for shared representa-\ntional spaces.\n2. Unsupervised Data Augmentation: Tech-\nniques like adversarial training and cross-\nlingual sample generation are employed by\nRiabi et al. (2021); Bari et al. (2021); Dong\net al. (2021); Guo et al. (2021) to improve\nmultilingual model performance. Nishikawa\net al. (2021) use back translation for enhancing\nword embeddings, while Cheng et al. (2022)\nreplace words based on a probabilistic distri-\nbution. Chen et al. (2021) focus on sentence\nselection from low-resource languages. These\nmodels tend to prioritize surface string varia-\ntions, often overlooking the rich, context-aware\nsemantics.\nWe address this limitation by incorporating global\ncross-lingual semantics into monolingual training\ndata, thereby enriching the diversity of language\nknowledge.\n6.\nConclusion\nIn this work, we introduce UniPSDA, an unsuper-\nvised data augmentation mechanism that leverages\nsemantic embeddings to enrich cross-lingual nat-\nural language understanding (NLU) tasks with di-\nverse linguistic information. The Domino Unsuper-\nvised Cluster module identifies semantically similar\ncross-lingual content, while the Pseudo Semantic\nData Augmentation module injects context-aware\nsemantics into the training corpus. Furthermore,\naffinity regularization serves to minimize the repre-\nsentational gap between original and augmented\nsentences. Through extensive experimentation,\nour methods demonstrate superior performance rel-\native to other strong baselines, underscoring their\neffectiveness in enhancing cross-lingual NLU.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank anonymous reviewers for\ntheir valuable comments.
