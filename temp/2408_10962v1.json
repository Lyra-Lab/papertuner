Due\nto the increasing interest in NLP, in this paper we try to condense research efforts for the automatic\nprocessing of Greek language covering the last three decades. In particular, we list and briefly discuss\nrelated works, resources and tools, categorized according to various processing layers and contexts.\nWe are not restricted to the modern form of Greek language but also cover Ancient Greek and various\nGreek dialects. This survey can be useful for researchers and students interested in NLP tasks,\nInformation Retrieval and Knowledge Management for the Greek language.\n1\nIntroduction\nThere is a wide variety of methods, tools and resources for processing text in the English language. However this is not\nthe case for the Greek language even though it has a long documented history spanning at least 3,400 years of written\nrecords (including texts in syllabic script), and 28 centuries (Archaic period - new) of written text with alphabet [1, 2].\nThe over 2500 years literary tradition of Greek is also notable. To aid those that are interested in using, developing\nor advancing the techniques for Greek processing, in this paper we survey related works and resources organized in\ncategories. We hope this collection and categorization of works to be useful for students and researchers interested in\nNLP tasks, Information Retrieval and Knowledge Management for the Greek language. Indeed, there is an everlasting\nand vivid discussion on how computational tools can help in the study and research of Greek texts starting from the rich\nproduction of Ancient Greek literary work [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] ending with Modern Greek and the various Greek dialects.\nModern Greek is an independent branch of the Indo-European family of languages, the sole descendant of Ancient\nGreek. It is the official language in Greece and one of the two official languages in Cyprus (along with Turkish). There\nare Greek-speaking enclaves in Albania, Bulgaria, Italy, North Macedonia, Romania, Georgia, Ukraine, Lebanon,\nEgypt, Israel, Jordan, and Turkey. The Greek language is also spoken by a significant number of people belonging to\nGreek diaspora i.e., communities of people with Greek origin living outside of Greece and Cyprus. Such Grecophone\ncommunities exist in USA, e.g., Tarpon Springs, Astoria, Australia e.g., Melbourne, Canada, Germany, the United\nKingdom and in other countries too.\nA few characteristics or particularities of the Greek language that make some NLP tasks challenging, follow. Greek\nwords are typically polysyllabic with function words to be usually shorter than content words [8]. There is a highly\nconsistent alphabetic orthography with minor complexities [9]. Morphology is a developed component in the grammar\nof Greek since it exhibits productive word-formation patterns for both derivation e.g., suffixation, prefixation and\ncompounding [10]. It has an extensive set of productive derivational affixes, whereas the rich productivity of compounds\nstems from a relatively limited system of compounding. Greek is a language highly inflected based predominantly\non suffixes but there are also few infixes and one inflectional prefix. There are many different suffixes in the nominal\nsystem due to the number (singular and plural), the four cases (nominative, genitive, accusative, and vocative), the three\ngenders i.e., masculine, feminine and neuter, let alone irregular formations. Case, number and gender are marked on\narXiv:2408.10962v1  [cs.CL]  20 Aug 2024\nNLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024\nthe noun as well as on articles and adjectives modifying it. Verb in turn have two different stems (imperfective and\nperfective), while there are several cases of irregular verbs.\nIn terms of syntax, Greek language has a fairly free word order and it is a null-subject language (e.g., the phrase “Jason\nhas started\" can be expressed in Greek both as “Ο Ιάσονας ξεκίνησε\", and “Ξεκίνησε.\" depending on the context) [11].\nOther characteristic features of the language are: the clitic doubling (a tendency to use pre-verbal clitic object pronouns\nredundantly e.g., “I gave Maria the sweets\" /“(Της) (τα) έδωσα της Μαρίας τα γλυκά \", “I show John\" / “(Τον)\nείδα (τον Γιάννη)) and the lack the lack of a typical infinitive. In the course of the years, we observe the merging\nof the dative and the genitive case. More specifically, indirect objects are expressed partly through genitive forms of\nnouns or pronouns, and partly through a periphrasis consisting of the preposition σε / to while some dative fossils\nstill remain1 for example ελλείψει / in shortage, επ’ αυτοφώρω / red-handed. Lastly, the nominative and accusative\ncase syncretism creates interesting ambiguities in sentences like Ανατροπές έφεραν τα εκλογικά αποτελέσματα /\nThe election results brought upheavals.\nOn the evolution of the language, over the centuries, we could mention that Modern Greek language’s rich vocabulary\nhas retained many Ancient Greek words either as whole words or as stems. These words have morphologically adapted\nto the rules of Modern Greek and also many ancient words have also evolved grammatically or semantically. In terms\nof grammar, some of the changes include the loss of the dative case, the loss of the infinitive and the loss of the dual\nnumber [12]. Ancient Greek had verbs while the modern language has verb phrases (analytical forms of verbs). Greek\nseems to be affected by both language internal factors and by borrowing from languages it has been in contact with [13].\nMost of the older “loans” has been fully adapted to the system of the language while some newer loans mostly from\nEnglish and French have remained inact causing difficulties in the computational processing tools. An analytical\ndescription of Modern Greek Grammar can be found in [14].\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes previous surveys on Greek NLP, and the methodology\nthat we followed. Section 3 surveys the works on Greek NLP. Section 4 describes some noteworthy resources and\nevaluation collections that are available, and finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.\n2\nOther surveys and methodology\nThere are not many papers that attempt to survey this area. We have found the 2010 paper [15], the white paper [16] and\nits recent update [17]. There is also some surveys about particular topics like [18] that focuses on tools for sentiment\nanalysis in Greek, [19] that surveys social web datasets for Greek and the applicable mining techniques, [20] that\nsurveys NLP for the Greek legal domain and [21] that is focused in the healthcare NLP infrastructure for the Greek\nLanguage.\nFor the Ancient Greek, we found an entry in “Encyclopedia of Ancient Greek Language and Linguistics” [22] that\nbriefly discusses available digital resources and methods for the processing of Ancient Greek.\nThe current paper is an expanded and more analytical version of the paper [23]. In comparison to that paper, the current\nsurvey: is more complete in the sense that [23] contained 99 references, while the current paper contains 221 references,\nit provides a more rich categorization, and it contains more tables that summarize the available information for aiding\nthe reader to find out what it is available, As regards the latter, the current paper contains tables that describe the\navailable (i) domain specific annotated datasets (Table 4), (ii) embeddings for the Modern Greek (Table 5) and Ancient\nGreek (Table 6) language, (iii) toolkits and their functionality (Tables 7 and 8), (iv) tools and related references (Table\n9), and (v) tools and resources offered via online interfaces (Table 10).\n2.1\nMethodology for the current survey\nFor finding the related works we used Google Scholar, ResearchGate, DBLP, and the ACL Anthology in the period:\nApril 2020 - December 2022, without any restriction on the publication date. Although we did not used any filter, the\nmajority of works that we retrieved concerns the last three decades. We started by collecting all papers that contain the\nword “Greek” in the title and we used various extra keywords and keyphrases for finding the related papers.\nIn particular we used the following queries : “Greek\" plus one of the following (we list them on alphabetical order and\nin lowercase):\n“abusive language, anaphora resolution, ancient nlp, ancient, argument extraction, argument mining,\nauthorship attribution, authorship, chatbot, computational journalism, computational linguistics,\ncomputational pragmatics, computational semantics, computational lexicons, controlled natural\n1More examples can be found at https://www.eleto.gr/download/Orogramma/Dotikes_KValeontis.pdf.\n2\nNLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024\nlanguages, coreference, corpora list, corpora, corpus, cypriot, dataset, deception detection, dialects,\ndialogue systems, education nlp, embeddings, entailment, fake news, greeklish, hate speech, hyphen-\nation, law, legal, lemmatization, machine translation, modern, morphology, named entities extraction,\nnamed entities recognition, named entity linking, natural language processing, natural language\nunderstanding, natural language generation, natural language processing literature review, natural\nlanguage processing survey, nlp in health, ocr, offensive language, opinion analysis, phonetics,\nphonology, abusive language, pos, question answering, readability, sentiment analysis, sentiment\nlexicons, slang, spelling checkers, stemmers, stemming, summarization, syllabification, syntactic\nparsers, syntax, text processing, transformers, transliteration\".\nWhenever we considered necessary, we expanded our searches in order to find follow-up, more mature works or related\nresearch projects, growing in this way the thread of our searches. A similar process was followed for finding resources\nand evaluation collections. The queries were modified accordingly, and apart from the aforementioned sources we also\nused general-purpose web search engines.\nWe did not focus on papers that deal with multilingualism and could potentially contain Greek as well. Consequently,\nthe survey is by no means complete, however we tried to find the more relevant and fundamental works and resources\nfor giving a concise overview. However the reader must be aware and keep an eye also on approaches like transfer\nlearning, distant supervision and data augmentation since they can be of great benefit on NLP tasks in the absence of\nresources [24, 25]. In the sections that follow when we refer to Ancient Greek, we mean the historical language as\ndetermined in the ISO 639-3 code set classification with language index grc2. The usual cutoff for this distinction is the\ndate of 1453 (the Fall of Constantinople).\nLater, in Section 3.2, we provide the time distribution of the examined papers.\n3\nSurvey of works on Greek NLP\nAt first, in Section 3.1, we provide a categorization of the various NLP tasks (shown in Figure 1). Then, in Section 3.2,\nwe provide a quantitative overview of the surveyed works. The rest subsections, from Section 3.3 to Section 3.14, are\nbased on the categorization introduced in Section 3.2. Tables 2 and 3 that are embedded in Section 3 summarize works\nin POS tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER) respectively.\n3.1\nCategorization\nIn this survey we group the available works according to various processing layers and contexts, namely: object\ncharacter recognition (§3.3), phonetics (§3.4), morphology (§3.5), syntax (§3.6), embeddings (§3.7), semantics (§3.8),\npragmatics (§3.9), sentiment analysis (§3.10), question answering (§3.11), natural language generation (§3.12), machine\ntranslation (§3.13). An overview of the topics that are addressed (up to some degree) is given in Figure 1.\nHowever we also include a section that refers to works that capture several layers, as well as sections on related\ntopics (§3.14), including dialect detection, lip reading, Greek sign language, keyword spotting, argument mining,\ncomputational journalism, health domain, crowd-sourcing, metaphor detection, irony detection, genre identification,\nfake news detection, legal domain, authorship, education - analytics, controlled natural languages. Resources and\nevaluation collections are described afterwards, in Section 4.\nWe are aware that a work may fit to more than one category, however we have decided to avoid duplicates. We have\nalso decided to avoid the inclusion of quantitative results because such numbers would not be comparable since in\nmost cases they are based on experiments over different collections (the interested user can refer to the mentioned\npapers for quantitative results). The works in each section are described in chronological order. Whenever it was more\nsensible we also grouped some papers thematically. Note also that some works or projects have been published in more\nthan one paper. In such cases we include one of these works; the interested reader could perform more searches to\nfind subsequent or related works through the usual channels (e.g., google scholar, dblp, authors’ pages or pages of the\norganizations they are affiliated to) since it is impossible this survey to be exhaustive. As regards distribution in time,\nFigure 1 also shows the year intervals of the found works by category.\nTo aid the understanding of the categorization and the output of the basic NLP tasks,\nFigure 2 shows a small and typical NLP example, i.e., a small Greek phrase, specifically “Ο Αριστοτέλης είδε την\nκοπέλα με το τηλεσκόπιο” (Aristotle saw the girl with the telescope), and how the results of some basic NLP tasks\nmight be.\n2https://iso639-3.sil.org/sites/iso639-3/files/downloads/iso-639-3_Name_Index_Latin1.tab\n3\nNLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024\nFigure 1: Categorization of works in the survey enriched with the publication year of the oldest work per category that\nwe have included in this survey.\nNotice the various ambiguities that exist: “Aristotle” could refer either to the ancient philosopher, or to Aristotle Onassis\n(Greek shipping magnate), or even to a modern person, while the phrase “with the telescope” may refer to “saw” (i.e.,\nAristotle saw the girl through his telescope) or to “girl” (e.g., Aristotle saw the girl carrying her telescope), exhibiting a\nkind of syntactic ambiguity i.e., prepositional phrase (PP) attachment.\nOf course, there are many other types of ambiguities and challenges that computational processing tools must grasp.\nThe free word order can pose some difficulties since even this simple utterance can be formed in various alternative\nways giving emphasis on different parts (e.g. the above phrase could be formed as ”την κοπέλα με το τηλεσκόπιο\nείδε ο Αριστοτέλης”). In addition, the clitic doubling (e.g. expressing the above utterance as ”την κοπέλα με το\nτηλεσκόπιο την είδε ο Αριστοτέλης”), and the pro-drop feature must be also taken into account in tasks like syntactic\nparsing, machine translation, natural language generation, coreference resolution etc.\nSuch ambiguities make the general objective of NLU (Natural Language Understanding) very challenging. We can\nunderstand the intended meaning(s) only by considering (and properly analyzing) the context of the text.\n3.2\nQuantitative Overview\nA few questions that we have had at the beginning were: (a) what is the distribution of papers per year, (b) how the\nnumber of papers about Ancient Greek compares with those about Modern Greek?, and (c) does the zest for the advance\nof Greek NLP is only a matter of researchers and institutions residing in Greece? Table 1 shows the distribution in\ndecades of the papers mentioned in this survey. We have split the last decade in two rows (corresponding to 5 and 7\nyears respectively) to make clear the trend. We have observed: (i) a significant overall increase over the last years,\n(ii) an increase in works based on neural networks, (iii) a relatively high number of papers on sentiment analysis with\nspecialized solutions for the Greek language, and (iv) an emerging interest for dialogue systems. Another interesting\nremark is that we found more works about Ancient Greek than we expected, 19% of the works that we found concerns\nAncient Greek.\nAs regards to the origin of the authors of these works we noticed a clear distinction between studies about Ancient Greek\nand Modern Greek. Most of the studies referring to the Modern Greek language originated from Greek universities and\ninstitutions with some exceptions i.e., the work in [26], plus three master theses [27], [28] and [29], that are conducted\nabroad. In contrast, the authors of works related to Ancient Greek are affiliated with organizations outside Greece. It is\n4\nNLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024\nFigure 2: Example of some basic NLP tasks over a Greek phrase\nindicative that the first NLP work reported in this survey, mostly for historical reasons, concerns a POS tagger created\nto assist students in the learning of Ancient Greek [3].\nTable 1: Distribution of papers and resources per year.\nPeriod\nModern\nGreek\nAncient\nGreek\nDialects\nGreek Sign\nLanguage\nTotal\n[1990-2000) (10 years)\n10\n2\n-\n-\n12\n[2000-2010) (10 years)\n29\n4\n1\n2\n36\n[2010-2015) (5 years)\n25\n3\n1\n-\n29\n[2015-2022) (7 years)\n99\n33\n6\n5\n143\nTOTALS\n164\n42\n8\n7\n221\nWith respect to the time period when a topic is first introduced in the literature, Figure 1 presents the topic categorization\nenriched with year intervals.\nAnother interesting question, is how many papers concern each particular topic. Such counts can be construed as\nindicators of how much/well a topic has been elaborated in the literature. In addition, they enable the reader to identify\ngaps and directions that have not been explored so far. To this end, Figure 3 shows how many papers occur in the\ncorresponding subsection sorted in descending order.\nWe can observe that the most frequent topics are: syntax/POS tagging, morphology and sentiment analysis. The same\ninformation is presented as a tree map in Figure 4. Finally, Figure 5 shows the number of papers per topic, but for\nAncient Greek only.\n3.3\nOptical Character Recognition (OCR)\nOptical Character Recognition (OCR) refers to the process of converting images of typed, handwritten or printed text\ninto machine-readable text.\n3.3.1\nAncient Greek\nWe have identified three works about OCR over Ancient Greek.\n[30] focus on the problem of recognizing old Greek manuscripts and propose a segmentation-free recognition technique\ntested in historical manuscript collections which are written in lowercase letters and originate from St. Catherine’s\nMount Sinai Monastery.\n5\nNLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024\nFigure 3: Number of papers per topic (sorted)\nFigure 4: Number of papers per topic as a tree map\n6\nNLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024\nFigure 5: Number of papers about Ancient Greek per topic (sorted)\n[31] describes a process for training the open-source Tesseract OCR engine [https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/\ntesseract] to support Ancient Greek. One of the challenges in this work is the recognition of the two types of diacritical\nmarks of Ancient Greek, breathing marks and accents.\n[32] focus on large-scale optical character recognition of ancient (or polytonic) Greek; the approach is based on the\nGamera framework [https://gamera.informatik.hsnr.de/index.html], and they report results from processing\n1,200 volumes comprising about 330 million Greek words.\n3.3.2\nModern Greek\n[33] and [34] describe methods for Greek handwritten character recognition evaluated over handwritten character and\ndigit databases. In the first one a hybrid feature extraction scheme was employed, while in the second one the extraction\nis based on recursive subdivisions of the character image so that the resulting sub-images at each iteration have balanced\n(approximately equal) numbers of foreground pixels.\n[35] present an approach for the recognition of Greek polytonic scripts by training and testing a Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) [36] based recognizer using the OCRopus framework [https://github.com/tmbarchive/ocropy].\nIn this context, the authors created the publicly available database Polyton-DB that extends the previous GRPOLY-\nDB [37] consisting of scanned pages only. The Polyton-DB contains 15,689 textlines of synthetic and authentic printed\nGreek polytonic script.\n[38] describe the design and development of an OCR tool for the recognition of Greek printed polytonic scripts. The\nproposed framework includes the whole process including data gathering and structuring, OCR tool development, user\ninterface development, experiments on the training procedure of the tool, evaluation, post-correction and quality control\nof the results.\n3.3.3\nEndangered dialects\n[39] develop an OCR post-correction method tailored for endangered dialects by adopting a sequence-to-sequence\narchitecture. This work also introduces a benchmark dataset with transcribed images in three endangered languages,\nnamely Ainu, Griko, and Yakkh. Griko [40] is a Greek dialect spoken in the area of Southern Italy called Grecìa\nSalentina. All the resources are available at [https://shrutirij.github.io/ocr-el/].\n3.4\nPhonetics/ Phonology\nPhonetics is a branch of linguistics that studies the sounds of human speech. Phonology is the study of the organization\nand function of speech sounds in a given system (language). Although the differences are well-established sometimes\nthese terms are equated [41].\nThe 1972 book [42] studies Greek phonology in general, while [43] focuses on the Greek dialect vowel systems. [41]\ndescribes the 2007 state of the art in Greek phonetics.\n7\nNLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024\n[44] present an algorithm for the generation of intonation (F0 contours) for the Greek Text-To-Speech system devel-\noped at Wire Communications Laboratory. [45] analyze the acoustic characteristics of the Greek vowels (duration,\nfundamental frequency, amplitude, and others). Along the same line, [46] analyzes the acoustic characteristics of Greek\nvowels produced by adults and children. [47] apply a decision-tree based approach for learning Greek phonetic rules.\nIPAGreek ([48]) is an implementation (available at [49]) of Standard Modern Greek and Cypriot Greek “phonological\ngrammar”. The application enables users to transcribe text written in Greek orthography into the International Phonetics\nAlphabet (IPA).\n[50] proposes an automatic machine learning (ML) approach that learns rules of how to transcribe Greek words into\nthe International Phonetics Association’s (IPA’s) phonetic alphabet. [51] describes classification approaches based on\ndeep neural networks for distinguishing two Greek dialects, namely Athenian Greek, the prototypical form of Standard\nModern Greek and Cypriot Greek. Finally, [52] propose a family of algorithms for phonetic matching for Greek text\n[https://github.com/YannisTzitzikas/SoundexGR], for example the 4 characters length phonemic transcription of\n“Αριστοτέλης” is “a8@4”, while the full phonemic transcription is “aristotelis”.\n3.5\nMorphology\nMorphological parsing is the analysis of word structure and it is usually a prerequisite for many text processing tasks.\nIndeed, some of the first efforts in processing Greek text were towards the creation of tools for this level of linguistic\nanalysis [3, 53]. Due to the rich morphology of Greek language, related tasks such the automated lemmatization (i.e.,\nthe removal of inflectional suffixes for getting the base form of a word), stemming (i.e., the reduction of all the inflected\nforms of word into a common canonical form without the need to be meaningful), hyphenation (i.e., splitting a token\nover two lines with a hyphen symbol) and spell checking, are challenging.\n3.5.1\nAncient Greek\n[54] presents a set of rules for the hyphenation of Ancient Greek taking into account characteristics such as the diversity\nof compound terms, declension, diacritics as well as special cases in which identical words have different meanings and\ndifferent hyphenation. The resulting resource is incorporated in the ScholarTex package [55].\n[56] proposes a morphological analyzer that is based on the nearest-neighbor machine learning framework [57] and\ndoes not require hand-crafted rules contrary to previous existing approaches such as in the classical works [3] and [53].\nIt is also able to predict unseen words and to rerank its predictions by exploiting an unlabelled corpus of Ancient Greek.\n[58] investigates the effectiveness of evolutionary computation algorithms in the morphological segmentation of words\ninto subword segments, focusing on the definition of stems and endings.\n[59] describe GLEM, a publicly available lemmatizer [https://github.com/GreekPerspective/glem] for Ancient\nGreek that uses POS information for disambiguation. GLEM is able to assign output to unseen words.\n[60] [https://github.com/sommerschield/ancient-text-restoration] focus on the recovery of missing characters\nfrom a damaged text input using deep neural networks.\n[61] [https://github.com/deepmind/ithaca] is a close-related and follow-up work of [60] that utilizes a deep neural\nnetwork trained simultaneously to perform the tasks of textual restoration, geographical attribution and chronological\nattribution for ancient Greek inscriptions.\n3.5.2\nModern Greek\n[62] present the implementation of a morphological processor for the Modern Greek language that is based on the\ntwo-level morphology model introduced by [63].\nA rule-based hyphenator has been presented in [64] that derives rules from grammar and phonology, while a few years\nlater [65] presents hyphenation patterns created for Ancient and Modern Greek to correct mistakes or to complete\npatterns previously found on related CTAN (Comprehensive TEX Archive Network) [https://www.ctan.org/] packages.\n[66] presents an interactive spelling correction system for Modern Greek. The system is based on a morphological\nlexicon and emphasis was given not only on dictionary’s coverage, but also on describing the rich inflectional morphology\nof Greek as economically as possible.\n[27] [https://github.com/skroutz/greek_stemmer] describes a stemmer for the Greek language that follows the\nknown Porter algorithm for the English language and it is developed according to the grammatical rules of the Greek\nlanguage. Along the same line, [67] present a stemmer for the Greek language that follows again an affix removal\napproach (as the Porter’s Algorithm).\n[68] and [69] introduce another stemmer [http://saroukos.com/stemmer]\n8\nNLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024\nfor the Greek language and compare it with previous implementations, while [70] provide a stemming and tagging\nprocedure for the Greek language that can be easily adapted to existing systems.\n3.5.3\nEndangered dialects\n[71] present the design and the implementation process of a tri-dialectal dictionary for three Greek dialects in Asia\nMinor, namely Pontic, Cappadocian and Aivaliot.\n3.6\nPOS tagging and syntactic parsing\nPart-of-speech (POS) tagging (also called grammatical tagging) is the process of marking up a word in a text as\ncorresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context. Syntax concerns the\nprinciples governing the arrangement of words in sentences, clauses and phrases as well as the relations among\nthese parts [72]. The creation of computational grammars that adapt frameworks from theoretical linguistics and\nthe part-of-speech tagging, e.g., see an example of such analysis for the word “είδε” in the phrase of Figure 2,\nare the backbone tasks, as the study of the literature showed. Again the high degree of inflection of the Greek\nlanguage can add difficulty in computational approaches. It is indicative that a tagset for the Greek language, e.g.,\n[http://nlp.ilsp.gr/nlp/tagset_examples/tagset_en/index.html], can be many times larger than that for English,\ne.g., Penn Treebank [73].\n3.6.1\nAncient Greek\n[74] describe the first release of the Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank [https://perseusdl.github.io/treebank_\ndata/] (AGDT), a 190,903-word syntactically annotated corpus of literary texts including the works of Hesiod, Homer\nand Aeschylus.\nThe thesis of [75] describes the implementation of a rule-based POS tagger for Ancient Greek.\n[76] compare five statistical POS taggers, i.e., the Mate tagger [77], the Hunpos tagger [78], RFTagger [79], the\nOpenNLP POS tagger, and the NLTK Unigram tagger. The data from Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank [74] were\nused to train and compare the POS taggers. The results, with respect to the overall accuracy, showed that the Mate\ntagger performed better than any other tagger.\nAnother thesis [80] describes the implementation of a POS-tagger and a lemmatizer by employing traditional machine\nlearning algorithms i.e., support vector machines (SVM) [81] and Conditional Ranfom Fields (CRF) [82].\n[83] describes a dataset comprising a collection of dependency syntax trees of representative texts from ancient\nGreek prose authors (Aeschines, Antiphon, Appian, Athenaeus, Demosthenes, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Herodotus,\nJosephus, Lysias, Plutarch, Polybius, Thucydides, and Xenophon), totalling to date more than 550,000 tokens.\n[84] present a “roadmap” on how different already available treebanks in Ancient Greek, namely Perseus Ancient\nGreek Dependency Treebanks, Aphthonius, Pedalion, Gorman, Sematia and PROIEL, can be combined to enhance the\nprogress in the automated parsing of classical and post-classical Greek texts.\n3.6.2\nModern Greek\nTo facilitate the reader, below we first discuss the works related to POS tagging (which are numerous), and then the rest\nworks about syntax. An overview of the Greek POS works is given in Table 2.\n- POS tagging\n[85] describe a rule-based POS tagger by employing dictionaries of non-inflected words, affixation morphology and\nlimited surface syntax rules.\n[86] describe a machine learning approach for POS disambiguation and unknown word guessing. Both problems are\ncast as classification tasks carried out by decision trees.\nIn [87] and in the PhD thesis [88] the use of transformation based error-driven learning [89] for resolving part-of-speech\nambiguity in the Greek language is investigated.\n[90] propose a unified POS tagging architecture that uses a feature-based multi-tiered approach to cover the requirements\nof tagging highly inflective languages such as Greek.\n9\nNLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024\n[91] propose an approach based on rules written in Prolog language for the generation of a lexicon of Greek compound\nmedical terminology. A similar approach is followed in [92] for the construction of a computational lexicon of Greek\nverbs for the stock market domain.\nIn [93] a Bayesian network probabilistic model is introduced for POS tagging in Greek texts.\n[94] present a method for morphological disambiguation in the absence of any gold standard corpora using several\nstatistical models, such as the Brill algorithm [89]. The methods were tested both on Greek and Yiddish.\n[95] describe a machine learning approach to POS tagging and named entity recognition for Greek, focusing on the\nextraction of morphological features and classification of tokens into a small set of classes, i.e., location, organization,\nperson and facility for named entities.\n[96] describe a part-of-speech tagged dataset of social text in Greek that contains 31,697 tokens originated from 2,405\ntweets.

The model was initialised from [109] model and\nsubsequently trained on monolingual Ancient Greek data.\n11\nNLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024\nSince embeddings are important in various tasks and several algorithms have been proposed in the literature [118],\nTables 5 and 6 in Section 4.3 list and provide more details about the available (monolingual) embeddings in Modern\nand Ancient Greek respectively.\n3.8\nSemantics\nThe semantic processing usually considers a representation of sentence structure (syntactic tree), a representation of\nthe possible meaning(s) of each word, and aims at producing a representation of the meaning of the sentence. This\nprocess includes steps like word sense disambiguation, semantic role tagging, named entity recognition and linking, and\nother tasks. Semantic role labeling aims at mapping spans in sentences to a predicate-argument structure. The structure\ndescribes eventualities and participants in the sentence and is often described as answering “Who did what to whom”\nquestion. Named entity recognition aims at identifying named entities, e.g. “Αριστοτέλης” in the phrase of Figure 2.\nNamed entity linking (NEL), also referred as entity linking is the task of semantically annotating entities mentioned in\ntext with entities described in knowledge bases (KBs).\n3.8.1\nAncient Greek\n[119] present an annotation scheme for semantic role annotation for the Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank.\n[120] describe a Bayesian model to study dynamically the semantic change of word senses in ancient text that leverages\ncategorical metadata about the texts’ genre to boost inference and uncover the evolution of meanings in Ancient Greek\ncorpora.\n[121] describe a vector space model where every word is represented by a vector which encodes information about its\nlinguistic context(s).\n[122] aim at computationally modelling Ancient Greek diachronic semantics based on Bayesian learning.\n[123] provides an approach for automatic role labeling in Ancient Greek based on a random forest classifier [124]. A\nsmall semantically annotated corpus of Ancient Greek was used, annotated with a large amount of linguistic features,\nincluding form of the construction, morphology, part-of-speech, lemmas, animacy, syntax and distributional vectors of\nGreek words. Overall, the distributional semantic vectors features proved more important in the model.\n[125] present a NER model for the recognition of place-names and ethnonyms trained on a small manually annotated\nlist. Their approach use Conditional Ranfom Fields and relies on the recurring elements in the context.\n3.8.2\nModern Greek\nTable 3 provides an overview of works on Named Entity Recognition.\n[126] describe a prototype NER (Named Entity Recognition) system for Greek texts developed based on a NER system\nfor English. Both systems are evaluated on corpora of the same domain and of similar size.\n[127] describe a named entity recognizer for Greek based on pattern matching and non-recursive regular expressions.\n[128] present a multimedia, multimodal and multilingual retrieval system. In terms of text processing, for the text\nproduced by the speech processing subsystem named entity detection, term recognition, story segmentation, and topic\nclassification is performed. For the NER task a finite state parser on the basis of a pattern grammar is employed.\n[129] describe a freely available named-entity recognizer [http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/software.html] for Greek texts\nthat identifies temporal expressions, person, and organization names. An ensemble of support vector machines\nand active learning was used for person and organization names while for the recognition of temporal expressions\nsemi-automatically produced patterns.\n[130] introduce a keyword extraction technique focusing on Greek URLs by combining a transliteration engine and a\ntokenizer.\n[131] describe a method for named entity recognition in Greek legislation using deep neural network architectures.\nThe recognized entities are used to enrich the Greek legislation knowledge graph with more detailed information\nabout persons, organizations, geopolitical entities, legislation references, geographical landmarks and public document\nreferences.\n[132] introduce a dataset focused on named entity recognition and further describe the experimentation with various\nstate-of-the-art models that are trained on this dataset.\n12\nNLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024\n[133] describe a pipeline for entity linking for Greek news articles. The pipeline consists of a BERT-based named entity\nrecognition step, a candidate generation step from a multitude of wiki-based KBs (Wikidata, DBpedia, Wikipedia,\nYAGO) and finally a disambiguation step based on context and no context dependent embeddings.\nTable 3: An overview of Greek NER work.

Pragmatics encompasses speech act theory, conversational implicature talk and other approaches.\nUnlike semantics that examines meaning as coded in a given language, pragmatics studies how the transmission of\nmeaning depends not only on structural and linguistic knowledge of the speaker and listener but also on the context of\nthe utterance [136, 137].\nThis process includes various (and challenging) tasks including: resolution of references (e.g., pronouns), resolution of\nsemantic ambiguities, inferring the missing objects and actions, drawing inferences based on world knowledge and\ncommon scenarios and scripts, linking sentences, identifying speech acts, understanding discussions and dialogues. For\nexample, from the perspective of Speech Acts Theory, the phrase of Figure 2 would be classified as Assertive.\n3.9.1\nAncient Greek\n[138] uses linguistic dependency treebanks and digitized texts created by the Perseus Digital Library, to create social\nnetworks for a collection of Greek tragedies that allow users to visualize the interactions between characters in the\nplays.\n3.9.2\nModern Greek\n[28] presents a classification of propositional basic illocutions (e.g., requests, wondering, curses etc.) in Modern Greek\nextracted following the linguistic choices speakers make when they formulate an utterance. The emphasis has been\ngiven on function of the illocutions rather than form.\nThe thesis of [139] describes a conversational chatbot system based on public services for a greek web portal called\ndiadikasies.gr to help citizens find easily the desired service.\n“Milisteros” is a chatbot, described in the thesis of [140], that employs a library in Python [https://github.com/\ngunthercox/chatterbot] to provide essential information about the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki to freshmen.\n[141] present Theano, a converational agent for COVID-19 information dissemination and symptom self-checking in\nGreek. Theano is implemented using the Rasa dialogue framework [142] and the code is available as open source at\n[https://gitlab.com/ilsp-spmd-all/public/covid-va-chatbot ].\n13\nNLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024\n[143] present PassBot a chatbot with the aim to provide personalized information to citizens interested in getting a Greek\npassport. Rasa was also used for this chatbot and the code is available at [https://github.com/PantelisAntoniadis/\nPassBot_project ].\n3.10\nSentiment analysis\nSentiment analysis is the process of computationally identifying opinions, emotions and attitudes expressed in a piece\nof text towards a particular topic, product, etc. For example, a tool for sentiment analysis would characterize the phrase\nof Figure 2 as neutral.\n[144] implement a sentiment classifier applying SVM on hotel reviews written in Modern Greek. The corpus of hotel\nreviews was collected from the Greek version of TripAdvisor and consists of 1,800 reviews (900 positive and 900\nnegative). A manually annotated sentiment lexicon also created in the context of this work that comprises a total of\n27,388 types of positive words and 41,410 types of negative words.\n[145] analyzes the sentiment of tweets related to schizophrenia in Greek language, in comparison with other illness\n(diabetes).\n[146] describe methodologies for both fully automatic and semi-automatic moderation in user comments. They propose\nthe use of a gating mechanism (GRU) in recurrent neural networks (RNN) on word embeddings. The results has been\nevaluated both on English and Greek datasets.\n[147] present an approach to recognize opinions in Greek language and examines the impact of feature selection on the\nanalysis of opinions and the performance of the classifiers (text-based and POS-based features from textual data are\nextracted).\n[148] focus on sentiment analysis applied in Greek texts, specifically it investigates a process where gradient boosting,\na technique for dealing with high-dimensional data, is applied on Greek texts.\n[149] examine the hashtag #greferendum, focusing on both social and semantic networks (#Grexit, #oxi campaign),\nand it analyses Twitter data, which were collected using NodeXL, on three significant days: the announcement of the\nreferendum, the day of the bailout expiration and the actual date of the referendum.\n[150] focus on the 2015 Greek bailout referendum, aiming to nowcast on a daily basis the voting intention of 2,197\nTwitter users. It proposes a semi-supervised multiple convolution kernel learning approach, leveraging temporally\nsensitive text and network information.\n[151] utilize Discourse-Historical Approach and content analysis for the analysis of Greek social media discourses on\nthe refugee crisis.\nIn [152] by employing a dataset consisting of all the documents that the members of the terrorist organization\n“Revolutionary Organization 17 November” (17N) have published, a rule-based categorization task is performed to\ndiscriminate between three categories: “no hate speech”, “moderate hate speech”, and “apparent hate speech”. Different\ntext analyzing techniques such as critical discourse and content analysis were preformed to decide the most effective\nparameters and their thresholds.\n[18] present a survey for sentiment analysis tools and resources in Greek, and makes publicly available a rich set of such\nresources [https://github.com/MKLab-ITI/greek-sentiment-lexicon], ranging from a manually annotated lexicon,\nto semi-supervised word embedding vectors and annotated datasets for different tasks.\n[153] present a longitudinal linguistic approach on the violence aspect of xenophobia for Greece. They performed event\nanalysis e.g., physical attacks and the involved social actors, using news data from 1995 to 2016 and a study on verbal\naggressiveness using Twitter data, locating xenophobic stances as expressed by Greeks in social media for the time\nperiod 2013-2016. A follow-up work [154] re-examine verbal aggression as an indicator of xenophobic attitudes in\nGreek Twitter three years later to trace possible changes.\n[155] present an approach to analyze Greek text and extract indicative information towards users’ opinions and attitudes.\nA supervised approach has been adopted to analyze and classify comments and reviews into the appropriate polarity\ncategory. Discretization techniques are also applied to improve the performance and the accuracy of classification\nprocedures.\n[156] describe the creation of a corpus of over 1,300 tweets and it analyzes these exchanges based on the analytical\ntools of the Lexical Constructional Model [157] (a framework that integrates the pragmatics and discourse dimensions\nof language use).\n14\nNLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024\n[158] present a sentiment analysis model for Greek tweets related to politics. A hybrid method that combines Greek\nlexicons and classification methods was followed.\n[29] present the first Greek annotated dataset for offensive language identification: the Offensive Greek Tweet Dataset\n(OGTD) [https://sites.google.com/site/offensevalsharedtask/home]. OGTD is a manually annotated dataset\ncontaining 4,779 posts from Twitter annotated as offensive and not offensive. The authors have also trained a number of\nsystems on this dataset and report that the best results have been obtained from a system using LSTMs and GRU with\nattention.\nIn [159] two available BERT type models for Greek (GreekBERT and PaloBERT, see more details in Table 5) were\nfine-tuned for the task of emotion detection in social media textual content written in the Greek language. The evaluation\nshowed that fine-tuned models outperform other approaches, especially those based on emotion lexicons.\n3.11\nQuestion Answering (QA)\nAutomatic QA systems are related to the long standing goal of retrieving precise answers to questions expressed in\nnatural language. Such systems have been introduced for the English language already in 60s like the BASEBALL\nsystem [160].\n[161] describe a natural language interaction system, that deals with questions for the treatment of pneumonia from\na medical database. The input question is transformed into a logical representation by employing a hybrid model of\npattern matching and shallow syntactic parsing.\n[162] present APANTISIS, a modular QA system implemented for the Greek language for plugging it to databases or\nknowledge bases.\n[163] evaluate five Machine Translation models, such as Bing and Helsinki, for translating contexts, questions and\nanswers for the task of QA. According to their experimental evaluation, the Bing model outperformed the others for the\nGreek language, since it offered a more human readable translation. In addition, they propose an approach for QA for\nthe Greek language by combining Machine Translation and BERT QA approaches. Sentence similarity embeddings\nwere used for deciding whether a predicted answer was correct, partially correct or wrong.\n3.12\nNatural Language Generation (NLG)\nNatural Language Generation refers to a process that takes as input data and text, and generates text in some human\nlanguage.\n[164] describe a computational grammar of Greek that is based on Systemic Functional Linguistics [165] for generating\nautomatically descriptions of museum exhibits from a database.\n[166] present an approach for the transformation of spontaneous telegraphic input to well-formed Greek sentences by\nadopting a feature-based surface realization for NLG.\n[167] present an algorithm based on grammatical rules and semantic information dedicated for Greek language for the\nextraction of document content summary.

The data were collected from the members of the Ellinika Hoaxes Facebook group.\n[212] propose a system for the automatic creation of fake news datasets that is based on the fake news stories (e.g.,\nfabrication, propaganda and parody) provided by curated fact-checking websites. The proposed method was used for\nthe creation of a Greek dataset with fake news tweets. Unfortunately, the created dataset is not available.\n3.14.13\nLegal domain\nThe automatic processing of law text could support both practitioners and general public to have better access to justice,\nrights and entitlements. However, the specialized characteristics of legal language requires a different treatment from\ngeneral text. We have identified four such works for the Greek language.\n[213] study standard stylometric features in a corpus of Greek legal texts. Further, statistical analysis is applied for the\ncomparison with a corpus of the general language. The formulaic language, the preference to nouns and impersonal\nconstructions, the use of technical vocabulary, and the length and complexity of sentences are among of the findings for\nlegal texts.\n[214] present a method based on regular expressions for the automated extraction of acronyms in legal Greek texts.\n[215] focus on Greek legislation documents and propose an approach for modeling and querying them based on\nSemantic Web technologies, as well as for their integration with other Linked Oped Data.\n18\nNLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024\n[216] present an ongoing project for the automated analysis and processing of Greek legal documents towards their\ntransformation into Legal Open Data.\n[217] study the task of classifying Greek legal texts. A dataset based on Greek legislation is introduced and then several\nmachine learning approaches are tested ranging from traditional machine learning, RNN-based and Transformer-based\nmethods (both monolingual and multilingual). Monolingual transformer-based models achieved the best performance.\n3.14.14\nAuthorship\nAuthorship identification (detection or attribution) refers to the process of determining the writer of a document based\non a collection of known documents. Author verification, plagiarism detection, author profiling or characterization and\nthe detection of stylistic inconsistencies are some other tasks of authorship analysis.\nIn [218] a method for discriminating among a close set of authors is presented. Each text is represented as a vector of\nfeatures covering several linguistic aspects and the discrimination analysis is based on statistical techniques.\n[219] explore topic influence in authorship attribution. They used a balanced corpus of two authors, whose newswire\narticles are equally divided in two distinctive topics, culture and politics. Many commonly used stylometric variables\nwere calculated and for each one they performed a two-way ANOVA test [220]. The results reveal that many stylometric\nvariables are actually discriminating topic rather than authors.\n[221] present a machine learning approach to automatically identify Big Five personality traits i.e., openness to\nexperience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism from the linguistic analysis of author’s text. The\nanalysis was based on texts produced by 382 participants that each one wrote an essay and complete a questionnaire.\nIn [222] a long lasting dispute about the authorship of Rhesus play, traditionally attributed to Euripides, is investigated.\nFrequency of words and character-grams analysis lead the authors to conclude that the author of Rhesus was probably\nan actor whose repertoire included Euripides and Aeschylus (but not Sophocles) who was a great admirer of Aeschylean\ngrandeur and style.\nIn another work for Ancient Greek [223] morpho-syntactic data without regard to specific vocabulary items are examined\nfor the task of author identification in short texts by exploiting supervised machine learning approaches. For Modern\nGreek, [224] employ a supervised learning approach for authorship attribution and use as features a mixture of n-grams\nboth in terms of size (bigrams and trigrams) and type (word and character n-grams). [225] present a comparative\nassessment of the difficulty of authorship attribution in Greek and in English. Based on a corpus introduced in this work\ndifferent methods of author attribution were applied and the results show that, overall, performance on English is higher\nthan performance on Greek.\n[226] introduces a BERT model for Ancient Greek. It demonstrates that Modern Greek BERT [109] after transfer\nlearning via Masked Learning Modelling (MLM) on several corpora of Ancient Greek texts could be further fine-tuned\nfor the authorship attribution task. The model is then used to assist an author and style attribution of a couple of recently\ndiscovered texts.\n3.14.15\nEducation - analytics\nNLP techniques has been also applied to facilitate teaching and learning processes in Greek.\n[227] investigate some of the most widely known readability measures namely Flech-Kincaid [228], SMOG [229] and\nFOG [230], for the Greek language and analyze the degree of their agreement.\n[231] present the tool “diaKeimenou\" that assesses the suitability of a text corpus for use in Greek language teaching by\nemploying various NLP tools (e.g., POS tagger, dependency parser etc). The assessment is based on four criteria: (i)\ntext readability, (ii) content, (iii) genre, and (iv) grammatical information.\n[232] describe the project “Lexipaignio” that intends to develop a NLP environment for the creation of digital educational\ngames for students of primary and secondary education in Greece. The games aim to cover a variety of school subjects\nsuch as Geography and Biology apart from Linguistics.\n[233] address the task of classifying Greek texts according to their readability score. For this purpose, textbook Greek\ncorpora are trained by using a total of 215 features.\n[234] introduce the Greek version of the automatic grammatical error annotation tool ERRANT [235] along with two\nevaluation datasets with errors from native Greek learners and Wikipedia Talk pages edits. Such a tool can have multiple\napplications to computer aided learning (CAL), for example to help learners of Greek as a Second Language.\n19\nNLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024\n3.14.16\nControlled natural languages\nControlled natural languages (CNLs) are subsets of natural languages that are obtained by restricting the grammar and\nvocabulary. The purpose of such languages is to reduce or eliminate ambiguity and complexity of natural language in\norder to facilitate tasks such as translation and retrieval. CNLs can have human or machine orientation.\n[108] describe a large-scale Greek morphological lexicon (along its architecture, construction and evolution process),\nthat was used to develop a lemmatiser and a morphological analyser. These tools were integrated in a controlled\nlanguage checker for Greek.\n[236] describe a set of controlled language specifications defined for Modern Greek, and examine the effectiveness\nand suitability of these specifications by assessing the performance of a commercial machine translation system over\ncontrolled texts.\n4\nResources and Evaluation Collections\nThis section is organized as follows: Section 4.1 lists a few portals containing various NLP resources for the Greek\nlanguage, Section 4.2 lists Greek dictionaries, lexicons and thesauri, Section 4.3 lists corpora and datasets suitable\nfor comparatively evaluating various NLP tasks (over Greek resources), and finally Section 4.4 presents some of the\navailable tools for processing Greek text.\nOverall, we concentrated on documenting linguistic resources with permissive licences and whenever it was feasible\nto provide the link to the downloadable resource. Besides of the open-source criterion, the selection of the resources\nwas based on other criteria too such as the community evaluation (when the resource is shared via repositories like\nGitHub4, e.g., stars), whether the resource is related to a peer-reviewed published work and our subjective view about its\nusefulness and easiness of integration in an application etc. Although, the availability of a resource was a determinant\nfactor for the inclusion of the resource in the following lists, we strongly advise the reader that want to reuse a resource\nto carefully check the license and/or contact the creator(s) for further clarifications.\n4.1\nPortals\nWe identified the following 12 portals that provide access to resources and informative content.

In\ntotal we have found, categorized and described in brief, around 166 papers, 38 corpora, 18 datasets, 10 toolkits, 25 tools\nand 19 web interfaces. We chose not to put emphasis to language agnostic approaches, without however question their\nsignificance, but instead to focus on works that take into account language and cultural characteristics of the Greek\nlanguage, following in this respect a recent publication thread [326, 327].\nWe have observed a rapid progress the last 7 years in all manifestations of Greek language (Ancient, Modern, dialects)\nthat spreads out to versatile tasks of NLP, and an increase of open resources. Around 19% of the works are about\nAncient Greek. Most of the studies about Modern Greek originate from Greek universities and institutes, while most of\nthe works about Ancient Greek originate from organizations outside Greece. We have found a relatively high number\nof papers on sentiment analysis, and a rekindle interest for dialogue systems. On the antipode, we have observed a\nrelatively low number of works in tasks like question answering, summarization and coreference resolution. Lastly, the\nneed of more datasets of a certain quality is a diachronic request for the progress of the area. The taxonomy in [328]\nthat is based on a quantitative investigation on labelled and unlabelled datasets for 2,485 languages, places Greek in\nthe middle of the 6-scale classification in the “Rising Stars” category. Clearly, there is room for improvement, at least\nfor the creation of lablelled datasets. Certain requirements like distribution in interoperable and standard formats,\ncontinuous maintenance, and application of ethical collection processes, must also be taken into account.\nWe believe our survey provides a timely guidance on the literature and resources about Greek NLP for researchers,\nengineers and educators.\nReferences\n[1] Geoffrey Horrocks.
