Spoken CS\ndata is scarce, and thus models for processing CS\nspeech often yield poor performance in comparison\nto monolingual models. Given that in many coun-\ntries CS is widespread (e.g. India, South Africa,\nNigeria) (Diwan et al., 2021; Ncoko et al., 2000;\nRufai Omar, 1983), it is essential to develop sys-\ntems for understanding and modelling CS speech.\nOne of the critical tasks in analyzing code-switched\nspeech is determining the matrix language (ML), or\nthe dominant language, which serves as the struc-\ntural framework for the utterance. Accurate identi-\nfication of ML is essential for various applications\nas well as sociolinguistic studies.\nTable 1: An example of a CS utterance transcription\nfrom the SEAME dataset of colloquial Singaporean\nlanguage.\nÊØï‰∏öËøáÂêéurh ‰Ω†ÁöÑstudy life Ë∑ü‰Ω†ÁöÑworking\nlife Êúâ‰ªÄ‰πàdifference Âêó\nThe linguistic Matrix Language Frame (MLF)\ntheory (Myers-Scotton, 1997) provides a model\nfor CS production and introduces the concept of a\nmain, i.e. dominant language and a secondary, in-\nserted language in CS utterances. These languages\nare ML and Embedded Language (EL), respec-\ntively. The MLF theory introduces two methods\nfor ML determination:\n1. The Morpheme Order Principle - ML will pro-\nvide the surface morpheme order for a CS\nutterance if it consists of singly occurring EL\nlexemes and any number of ML morphemes\n2. The System Morpheme Principle - all system\nmorphemes which have grammatical relations\nexternal to their head constituent will come\nfrom ML\nThe morphemes as units within the MLF frame-\nwork were first introduced by Myers-Scotton in\n1997 (Myers-Scotton, 1997) and were split into\ncontent and system morphemes. Some common\nexamples of system morphemes are quantifiers,\npossessives and tense/aspect determiners, while\ncontent morphemes include nouns, pronouns, ad-\njectives, verbs and prepositions.\nMatrix language identity (MLID) is the iden-\ntity of the language providing the grammatical\nframe for the utterance and it can be defined for\nboth monolingual and CS utterances. Moreover,\nthe existence of ML implies a certain token distri-\nbution following the System Morpheme Principle\n(Myers-Scotton, 2002) which is highlighted in fur-\nther Myers-Scotton works in the 4-M model. Over-\nall, MLID provides insight into the grammatical\narXiv:2410.02521v2  [cs.CL]  14 Nov 2024\nproperties of the utterance and a computational im-\nplementation of an MLID would be able to reduce\nthe amount of manual annotation.\nIn this paper three MLID systems for CS text\nand audio were implemented. MLF theory for-\nmulates The Morpheme Order Principle and the\nSystem Morpheme Principle, which were imple-\nmented into three systems for MLID determina-\ntion from text (P1.1, P1.2 and P2) and from au-\ndio (ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑ùëÉ1.1, ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑ùëÉ1.2 and ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑ùëÉ2). An\nextensive correlation analysis and comparison of\nan MLID determination system and a traditional\nacoustic language identities (LID) were carried out.\nRecognised MLID and LID from CS texts and au-\ndio were compared to ground truth ML annotation\nand the quality of ML recognition was measured\nin terms of F1 macro and Matthew‚Äôs Correlation\nCoefficient (MCC). To conclude the findings, the\ndistributions of textual LIDs were compared to the\ntextual MLID distributions of the CS data.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as fol-\nlows. The next section reviews the relevant re-\nsearch presented previously on MLF and LID in\nCS text and speech. The third section provides\na detailed description of the methods used. This\nis followed by a section on experiments, which\nprovides information on datasets, detailed imple-\nmentation, experiment descriptions as well as a\ndiscussion of results. Conclusions summarise and\ncomplete the paper.\n2\nRelated work\nMLF theory has rarely been used to automatically\nanalyse speech or text. Up until now it was only\nused for text augmentation (Bhat et al., 2016; Yil-\nmaz et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019) or for Language\nModel (LM) adaptation for code-switching. For\nexample additional grammatical information was\nused during LM construction (Adel et al., 2015;\nSoto and Hirschberg, 2019) or a self-supervised\ntraining procedure was set up which encouraged\ngeneration of CS utterances (Chang et al., 2019).\nMLID classification for CS text was carried out in\nBullock et al. (2018) where the ML was identified\nbased on the token and system POS majorities.\nSimultaneously in the speech processing domain\na common technique to separate languages in CS\nis LID. LID of a whole CS utterance may be per-\nformed when CS is regarded as a separate language\n(Mary N J et al., 2020), in this case the component\nperforms both LID and CS detection. A multi-\nlingual ASR system with an utterance-wise LID\ncomponent as an auxiliary task was tested for CS\nutterances in Toshniwal et al. (2018) but the model\nwas not able to generate CS text as a result. LID\nand language segmentation (LIS) systems make\ndecisions based on similarity to the data they were\ntrained on (Muralikrishna et al., 2021) and, to the\nbest of our knowledge, no study was done to de-\ntermine if pretrained LID/LIS are able to predict a\ndominant language in a CS utterance.\nNeither MLID nor LID were previously used for\nCS analysis. Furthermore, ML determination prin-\nciples were never fully implemented and compared.\nHowever, statistical methods were introduced be-\nfore (Guzm√°n et al., 2017) which can assess the\nnature of CS. Among the statistical methods only\nthe M-index (Multilingual Index) quantifies the\nrepresentation of the languages in multilingual cor-\npora. While the M-index is useful to learn about\nthe balance of the token LIDs, it might be insuffi-\ncient to learn about the utterance LID and MLID\ndistributions.\nThe above indicates that theoretical methods to\nidentify ML from text exist but previously there\nwas only one attempt to determine MLID which\nwas not based on the two ML determination prin-\nciples. Furthermore, there are no existing MLID\npredictors from audio to the best of our knowl-\nedge. Therefore the objective of this study is to\nadvance technologies for multilingual understand-\ning and analysis by describing the implementation,\ncomparison and performance of automatic MLID\npredictors from CS audio and text based on the ML\ndetermination principles from the MLF theory.\n3\nPrinciples for ML determination\nThe MLF theory principles mentioned above have\nto be implemented in order to compare the main lan-\nguage recognised by an LID system to the MLID.\nEach of them provides estimates for MLID but is\nconditioned by different evidence in the utterance.\nThe Morpheme Order Principle is separated into\ntwo implementations of the 1st Principle (P1.1 and\nP1.2). The implementations of the principle deduc-\ntion as per MLF theory are described below.\n3.1\nPrinciple 1.1: The singleton principle\nThe ML provides the context for singly occurring\nwords from the EL, which will be further referred\nto as \"singleton insertions\". Although the original\nprinciple operates on the level of lexemes, the cur-\nFigure 1: Detection error tradeoff (DET) curve for possible log ùõºvalues. Thin diamond is the default value of\nlog ùõº= 0, thick diamond - result of log ùõºestimation, red star - ground truth log ùõº.\nrent implementation operates on the level of words.\nSuppose there is a CS utterance y of length ùëõ, then\n(y‚Ä≤, l‚Ä≤) = ((ùúÄ, ùëôùúÄ), (ùë¶1, ùëô1), .., (ùë¶ùëõ, ùëôùëõ), (ùúÄ, ùëôùúÄ)) are\nmorphemes with corresponding language ID la-\nbels, ùúÄis an empty morpheme and ùëôùúÄis an empty\nlanguage morpheme tag from an empty language\nùêøùúÄ. If ((ùë¶ùëñ, ùëôùëñ), .., (ùë¶ùëó, ùëôùëó)) constitute a word where\n0 < ùëñ< ùëó< ùëõ+ 1, ‚àÄùëòthat ùëñ< ùëò< ùëó| ùëôùëò= ùêø2\nand ùëôùëñ‚àí1, ùëôùëó+1 ‚ààùêø1, ùêøùúÄthen the language of the\ncontext ùêø1 is the ML while ùêø2 is the embedded\nlanguage. For example in ‚ÄúÂì¶‰Ω†post Âú®‰Ω†ÁöÑÈÇ£‰∏™\nblog‚Äú Mandarin will be ML since it is a context for\nEnglish singleton insertions.\n3.2\nPrinciple 1.2: The token order principle\nFigure 2: Pipeline of the morpheme order-based princi-\nple for ML determination P1.2.\nIn P1.2 the second part of the Morpheme Order\nPrinciple is implemented which postulates that the\nmorpheme order is determined by the ML. For ex-\nample, in ‚Äú‰Ω†ËßâÂæóÊàë‰ª¨speak clear enough Âêó‚Äú the\nEnglish translation of the auxiliary Mandarin verb\nÂêówill never appear at the end of an utterance in\nEnglish, signifying that Mandarin is ML in this\nutterance. Assume languages (ùêø1, ùêø2) ‚äÇùêøare\npresent in a bilingual utterance where ùêøare all lan-\nguages, then the original CS utterance y can be\ntranslated into two monolingual utterances ÀÜyùêø1 and\nÀÜyùêø2. ÀÜyùêø1 and ÀÜyùêø2 are obtained from the original ut-\nterance y by a Neural Machine Translation (NMT)\nsystems ùëîùêø1 and ùëîùêø2. Consider an LM ùëÉ(ùêø|y)\nwhich is used to provide a probability of the utter-\nance belonging to a language ùêø, then given the two\nlanguages ùêø1 and ùêø2 classification leads to:\nùëÉ(y|ùêø1)ùëÉ(ùêø1)\nùëÉ(y)\n‚ãöùëÉ(y|ùêø2)ùëÉ(ùêø2)\nùëÉ(y)\n(1)\nIn the above the denominator may be eliminated.\nThe probability ùëÉ(y|ùêø) may be estimated using in-\ndependent monolingual LMs ùëÉùêø(y) and translation\nÀÜyùêødefined above ùëÉ(y|ùêø) ‚âàùëÉùêø(ÀÜyùêø) resulting in\nfollowing:\nùëÉùêø1(ÀÜyùêø1)\nùëÉùêø2(ÀÜyùêø2) ‚ãöùõº\n(2)\nWhere ùõºis the scaling factor for weighing the\nimpact of the models. Taking the log 2 leads to:\nlog ùëÉùêø1(ÀÜyùêø1) ‚àílog ùëÉùêø2(ÀÜyùêø2) ‚ãölog ùõº\n(3)\nAssume\nthe\ndifference\nof\nlanguage\nlog-\nprobabilities can be expressed in terms of a factor\nùõº. This factor may be estimated by calculating the\nexpectation of log-probabilities using utterances\nscored by monolingual LMs:\nlog ùõº= E{log ùëÉùêø1(yùêø1)} ‚àíE{log ùëÉùêø2(yùêø2)} (4)\nAll of the above leads to the following decision\nfunction:\nTable 2: Monolingual dataset splits used for LM training in P1.2.\nUnit\nCallhome\nEnglish\nCallhome\nMandarin\nCallhome\nSpanish\nToken set size\ntokens\n6160\n6853\n3236\nTrain\n20029\n15827\n19672\nValid\nutterances\n6030\n3959\n5500\nTest\n2609\n1775\n2665\nML =\n(\nùêø1, log ùëÉùêø1(ÀÜyùêø1) ‚àílog ùëÉùêø2(ÀÜyùêø2) ‚â•log ùõº\nùêø2, otherwise\n(5)\nA visual representation of the resulting algorithm\nis shown in Figure 2.\n3.3\nPrinciple 2: The system word principle\nFrom the examples in Section 1 it is evident\nthat there exists an overlap of content/system\nmorphemes duality with the traditional con-\ntent/function words opposition defined in linguis-\ntics, although they are not equivalent and the tra-\nditional classifications also not strictly distinguish-\nable. Therefore in the implementation of the 2\nPrinciple (P2) for ML determination instead of\ncontent/system morpheme duality (Myers-Scotton,\n2002) a content/function Part of Speech (POS) du-\nality is considered.\nSystem POS are identified, namely determiners,\nauxiliaries, subordinating conjunctions and coor-\ndinating conjunctions, while the rest of POS are\nconsidered as content POS. ML is determined in a\nCS utterance if one of the participating languages\nprovided function POS for the utterance and the\nother language did not. The language that pro-\nvided the function POS is determined as the ML.\nAlthough CS POS taggers exist (Feng et al., 2022;\nBansal et al., 2022) none of them are available in\nopen-source and since training a POS tagger is not\na goal of this work a monolingual POS tagger is\nused instead. For example in the utterance ‚Äúim\nokay with the ËõãÈªÑ‚Äú determiner ‚Äúthe‚Äú is used and\ntherefore ML is determined as English.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nDatasets\nThe experiments using the algorithms described\nabove are carried out using monolingual Call-\nhome subsets and 2 CS datasets: SEAME (Lyu\net al., 2010) and Miami subcorpus from the Miami-\nBangor corpus1.\n4.1.1\nMonolingual data\nMonolingual LM training for P1.2 was carried out\nusing Callhome datasets for English2, Mandarin3\nand Spanish4. Pretrained LMs were not used in\nthis work because they do not provide likelihood\nscoring of morpheme units. The summary of the\ndatasets is presented in Table 2.\n4.1.2\nCS data\nCS spoken language corpora SEAME (120 hours)\nand Miami (35 hours) are used for analysis and\nacoustic MLID training. Agreement analysis is car-\nried out for CS utterances from the SEAME and\nMiami corpora and monolingual SEAME and Mi-\nami utterances are used for estimating the scaling\nfactor ùõº(Table 4). The monolingual subsets of\nSEAME and Miami are also used for training the\nmapping from the LID outputs to English, Man-\ndarin and Spanish posteriors (ùêøùêºùê∑ùëöùëéùëù). Mandarin\ncharacters in the SEAME corpus are word seg-\nmented which is helpful when applying P1.1, a\nprinciple that operates with words. All the intro-\nduced principles require morpheme-level LID tag\nannotation which is available for Miami and is au-\ntomatically determined for SEAME based on the\nscript (latin vs logographic). Finally, additional\nMLID-annotated 91 CS Miami utterances were\nused to measure the quality of MLID prediction\nfrom text and audio. The annotated MLID labels\nwere assigned to the CS utterance transcriptions on\nthe basis of determiner-noun-adjective complexes\n(Parafita Couto and Gullberg, 2017).\n1https://biling.talkbank.org/access/Bangor/Miami.html\n2LDC97T14\n3LDC96T16\n4LDC96T17\nTable 3: Examples of applying the principles.\nUtterance\nbaseline\nML P1.1\nML P1.2\nML P2\ni thought all trains ÈÉΩÊòØvia jurongeast ÂéªÂà∞pasirris\nen\nen\nen\nen\nbut ‰ªñËõÆzai ÁöÑright\nen\nzh\nen\nen\nbut ÊàëÁöÑparents ÈÉΩÊ≤°Êúâsponsor Êàë\nzh\nzh\nzh\nen\nËøòÊúâchicken noodles\nen\nen\nen\nzh\nTable 4: CS dataset splits.\nUnits\nSEAME\nMiami\nMonolingual\n53086\n38401\nCS raw\nutterances\n56951\n2425\nCS annotated\n-\n91\n4.2\nApplying ML Principles to utterance\ntranscriptions\nP1.1 ML only applies to utterance transcriptions\nwith singleton insertions, therefore resulting in a\nsmall data coverage: only for 36% (SEAME) and\n60% (Miami) of the CS data the ML is determined.\nIn P2 POS tags are computed for constituent mono-\nlingual islands (segments) of a CS utterance using\na pretrained CNN-based POS tagger (Svenstrup\net al., 2017). P2 covered 31% (SEAME) and 58%\n(Miami) of all of the CS examples. Furthermore,\na baseline MLID determiner from text is imple-\nmented which is based on the token LID count\nfollowing Bullock et al. (2018). Examples of run-\nning the resulting principles implementations is\npresented in the Table 3.\nThe implementation of P1.2 includes three com-\nponents: a Machine Translation (MT) system, a\npseudomorpheme tokeniser and a language model\n(LM). CS utterances are translated word by word\nusing Wiktionary5 to preserve the token order. The\nEnglish and Spanish LMs are trained on the to-\nkenised English and Spanish Callhome datasets.\nThe tokenisation was carried out using a stemmer\nwhere stem and affix would be separated. For the\nMandarin Callhome dataset separate characters are\nregarded as morphemes. The two Transformer-\nbased (Vaswani et al., 2017) LMs with 2 lay-\ners, 2 attention heads per layer are trained for 25\nepochs with negative log-likelihood loss on one\n3080 Nvidia GPU for 1 hour. Validation and test\nperplexities for the three languages are presented\nin Table 5.\n5https://www.wiktionary.org/\nTable 5: Perplexities calculated for the validation and\ntest subsets of monolingual Callhome data.\nEnglish\nMandarin\nSpanish\nValid\n48.97\n94.98\n57.76\nTest\n57.61\n98.16\n52.30\nMoreover, a preliminary experiment is carried\nout to evaluate if the trained LMs have the ability\nto detect the original word order (WO) among its\npermuted variants (up to 20 word permutations).\nThe sequence of tokens for which the probability\nwas the highest was chosen as the predicted original\nWO. Comparing the sequence with chosen WO to\nthe original WO leads to 37% accuracy for SEAME\nand 60% for Miami.\nTable 7: Outcomes of ùõºestimation. \"-ùõºMCC\" is the\ncorrelation measured between the MLID determined by\nthe unscaled P1.2 approach and MLID labels from other\nprinciples (+ true MLID labels for Miami). \"+ùõºMCC\"\nare the correlation measurements with the scaled P1.2.\nSEAME\nMiami\nP1.1\nP2\nP1.1\nP2\ntrue\n-ùõºMCC\n0.31\n0.33\n0.36\n0.08\n0.41\n+ùõºMCC\n0.36\n0.31\n0.38\n0.09\n0.37\nOutputs of the pre-trained monolingual LMs\nhave different probability distributions, therefore,\nas described in Section 3, the factor ùõºis used to\nallow for scale changes. ùõºis derived from expecta-\ntions of the probabilities yielded on monolingual\nexamples and their translations following Equation\n4. As a result of ùõºestimation the MCC of SEAME\nP1.1/P1.2, Miami P1.1/P1.2 and Miami P2/P1.2\nhas increased (Table 7). Additionally, a \"true\" ùõº\nvalue is calculated using ground truth MLID for\nMiami and P1.1 and P2 MLID for SEAME, and\nthey are compared to the estimated ùõº. DET plots\nand highlighted thresholds in Figure 1 demonstrate\nthat by using the estimated ùõºthe amount of False\nPositives (FP) and False Negatives (FN) becomes\nmore balanced for SEAME. For Miami the ùõºes-\ntimation does not lead to more balanced FP and\nTable 6: Experimental results for SEAME.

An ECAPA-TDNN (Desplan-\nques et al., 2020) model pretrained on Voxlingua-\n107 (Valk and Alum√§e, 2020) was used to automati-\ncally detect the dominant language from audio data\n(Table 6 and 8, column ùêøùêºùê∑). The ECAPA-TDNN\nmodel was trained to recognise a large number of\nlanguages. In order to limit the models to binary\ntask a mapping function was trained from the out-\nputs based on a fully-connected neural network\n(Multi-Layer Perceptron, MLP) classifier.\nThe\nmapping function is trained to map 107 language\noutput posteriors to the binary output of the lan-\nguages participating in CS.

Due to the different coverage\nrates of P1.1, P1.2 and P2 of the CS data the amount\nof training data would vary greatly: 16582 for P1.1,\n43068 for P1.2 and 23868 for P2.

Higher correlation indicates that the\nprinciples in agreement may be used to generate\nground truth MLID labels for downstream tasks.\nCalculating MCC with unknown labels leads to ex-\ntremely low correlation due to a large portion of\nunknown labels which makes it impossible to as-\nsess the slight changes in correlation of the labeled\ndata (Tables 9 and 10).\nAmong the three principles P1.1 and P2 have the\ngreatest correlation (0.82 for SEAME and 0.81 for\nMiami), P1.1/P1.2 demonstrates less correlation\n(0.36 and 0.38), while the least correlation is ob-\nserved between P1.2 and P2 (0.31 and 0.09). P1.1\nand the baseline have almost identical behavior\nwhich is expected (0.99 and 1.0), whereas less cor-\nrelation is observed of the baseline with P2 (0.69\nand 0.67) and P1.2 (0.28 and 0.28).\nTable 10: Correlation values for Miami with unlabelled\nsentences given the \"unknown ML\" class.\nP1.1\nP1.2\nP2\nF1-macro true\n55%\n67%\n48%\nMCC true\n0.44\n0.37\n0.56\nMCC P1.1\n1\n0.1\n0.25\nMCC P1.2\n0.1\n1\n0.16\nMCC P2\n0.25\n0.16\n1\nThe high correlation values for P1.1 and P2\nprove that the MLF framework can reliably pre-\ndict the structure and behavior of CS text. This\nenables to use the MLIDs generated by the rule-\nbased principles as pseudo-labels in applications.\n4.5.2\nCorrelation of P1.1/P1.2/P2 and the\nacoustic LID/MLID\nThe ML determined from CS text is compared to\nthe LID computed from the corresponding audio.\nThe procedure for the LID experiments is described\nin the previous subsection. Columns 4 and 5 in\nTables 6 and 8 show the amount of correlation be-\ntween MLID derived from text and the recognised\nLID classes. The same columns for Miami in Table\n8 also include F1 macro and MCC for an annotated\nMLID subset. Training ùêøùêºùê∑ùëöùëéùëùon the monolin-\ngual utterances seems to increase the MCC (from\n0.27 to 0.35) but decrease the F1 macro (56% from\n53%) for the CS Miami data.\nSuppose a conventional LID system determines\nthe dominant language in a CS audio based on the\nmajority of time the language is spoken. Then the\ntrue annotation may be approximated by counting\nthe textual token LIDs in a CS utterance (Baseline).\nHowever, correlation analysis shows that ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑\nsystems are better predictors of the token LID ma-\njority (columns 4-5 vs 6-8 row MCC Baseline in\nTables 6 and 8).\nFurther experimentation comprises of compar-\ning ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑ùëÉ1.1, ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑ùëÉ1.2 and ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑ùëÉ2 with\nP1.1, P1.2 and P2. Upon observing the results for\nSEAME data ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑ùëÉ1.2 leads to overall highest\nvalue out-of-domain MCC scores (0.47+0.4=0.87)\nfor textual principles P1.1 and P2. A similar in-\nspection of the Miami results shows the biggest\nMCC scores for ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑ùëÉ1.1 (0.35+0.87). For the\nannotated subset of Miami data ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑ùëÉ1.2 leads\nto the biggest F1 macro among all systems (60%),\nwhile ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑ùëÉ2 leads to the biggest MCC score\n(0.38).\nTable 11: Distributions of languages in CS corpora. Utterance level LID for monolingual subsets is in the \"Utterance\nLID\" row, token level LID for CS is in the \"Token LID\" row and utterance level textual ML for CS are in rows\nP1.1/P1.2/P2.\nSEAME\nMiami\nEnglish\nMandarin\nEnglish\nSpanish\nUtterance LID (mono)\n54%\n46%\n68%\n32%\nToken LID (CS)\n42%\n58%\n66%\n34%\nP1.1 (CS)\n23%\n77%\n45%\n55%\nP1.2 (CS)\n44%\n56%\n31%\n69%\nP2 (CS)\n49%\n51%\n31%\n69%\nFigure 3: Correlations between acoustic ùêøùêºùê∑and\nùëÄùêøùêºùê∑outputs and textual P1.1, P1.2 and P2 for CS\nSEAME data. Each bar segment represents the amount\nof correlation for a LID or MLID model with textual\nprinciples, therefore the whole bar represents the sum\nof the correlations.\nFigure 4: Correlations between acoustic ùêøùêºùê∑and\nùëÄùêøùêºùê∑outputs and textual P1.1, P1.2 and P2 for CS\nMiami data.\nLastly, the MCC scores between the textual and\nacoustic MLID determiners are summed up for\nevery ùêøùêºùê∑/ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑approach (Figures 3 and 4). Re-\nsults show that the correlation of the proposed ap-\nproaches with the MLID is higher than in ùêøùêºùê∑\nsystems in all occasions apart from ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑ùëÉ1.2 for\nCS Miami data. The latter is due to the word order\nof the English and Spanish languages being similar\nin contrast to English/Mandarin CS. This leads to\nthe morpheme order having a better discrimination\npower in the case of English/Mandarin CS than in\nEnglish/Spanish CS.\n4.5.3\nP1.1/P1.2/P2 distribution analysis\nAt the last step of analysis the distributions of\nlanguages are measured on utterance level LID\nfor monolingual (Utterance LID row in Table 11),\ntoken level LID for CS (Token LID row in Ta-\nble 11) and utterance level textual MLID for CS\n(P1.1/P1.2/P2 rows in Table 11). The numbers re-\nveal that although the majority of the monolingual\nutterances are English in both corpora (54% for\nSEAME and 68% for Miami), it is not the pre-\nferred ML when CS occurs in the utterance for all\nprinciples. The token LID distribution also does\nnot seem to be correlated with the choice of the\nML in these corpora. In SEAME there seems to\nbe a strong preference towards using Mandarin as\nan ML (77%) when EL insertions are single words\n(P1.1). The preference is not as strong for Span-\nish in the CS Miami subset (55%) but it is still a\nbig difference in comparison to the monolingual\ndistributions (32%). P1.2 and P2 show a similar\ndistribution of MLIDs with the numbers indicating\nthe preference of speakers to use the non-English\nlanguage as the grammatical frame for a CS utter-\nance.\n5\nConclusion\nTo the best of our knowledge this is the first work\nthat precisely carries out the Matrix Language (ML)\ndetermination of a code-switched (CS) utterance\nbased on the Matrix Language Frame (MLF) the-\nory and that compares Matrix Language Identity\n(MLID) to acoustic Language Identity (LID). Three\nmethods for ML determination in text and audio\nare implemented using the ideas and the concepts\nof the MLF theory (Myers-Scotton, 1997). An ex-\ntensive correlation analysis of the MLID systems\nfrom text and speech is carried out. A pretrained\nLID system ùêøùêºùê∑is adapted to the data by train-\ning a mapping function ùêøùêºùê∑ùëöùëéùëù, while also map-\nping functions ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑ùëÉ1.1, ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑ùëÉ1.2, ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑ùëÉ2\nfor MLID are trained. ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑consistently outper-\nforms ùêøùêºùê∑for ML determination from audio based\non Matthew‚Äôs Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Com-\nparing the results to the ground truth ML annotation\nshows that the trained ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑ùëÉ1.2 and ùëÄùêøùêºùê∑ùëÉ2\noutperform ùêøùêºùê∑in terms of F1-macro and MCC\nrespectively. Finally, this approach reveals that\ndespite English dominating as the utterance LID\nfor the monolingual utterances, non-English (Man-\ndarin or Spanish) languages set the grammatical\nframe for CS utterances.\nThe proposed approaches can be used for ac-\ncurate automatic analysis of CS text and audio.\nIt can provide insight into the nature of CS for\nwhole datasets but also separate speakers and even\nutterances. Further work will explore the useful-\nness of the MLID implementations in Natural Lan-\nguage Processing and Automatic Speech Recogni-\ntion (ASR) applications, namely in language and\ndialogue modelling and also in end-to-end multi-\ntask ASR the MLID component will be used as a\npart of the ASR setup. Additionally, further devel-\nopment of P2 is required where the system mor-\nphemes would be automatically determined from a\ngiven set of CS data rather than using a closed set\nof POS tags.\nLimitations\nThe main limitation of the method is related to data\navailability: there is limited ML-annotated CS data\nopenly available to date. Therefore it is problem-\natic to assess the quality of ML classification. ML\nidentity can be determined in CS data using the\nP1.1 but the principle can only be applied in case\nof singleton EL insertions. Since there is no ML\nannotation, correlation was measured for most of\nthe experiments which is difficult to assess. Fi-\nnally, although providing valuable insight into the\nCS data, the usefulness of the method is yet to be\ntested in NLP and ASR applications.\nAcknowledgements\nMany thanks to Maria del Carmen Parafita Couto\nand Diana Carter for sharing the ML annotation for\nthe Miami-Bangor corpus.
