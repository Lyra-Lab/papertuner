By analyzing word\nfrequency, detecting emotional sentiments\nwith a BERT-based model, and examining\nrepetitive motifs, we unveil how Beckett’s\nminimalist yet complex language reflects\nthe protagonist’s fragmented psyche. Our\nresults demonstrate that recurring themes\nof time, memory, and existential angst are\nartfully woven through recursive linguis-\ntic patterns and rhythmic repetition. This\ninnovative approach not only deepens our\nunderstanding of Beckett’s stylistic contri-\nbutions but also highlights his unique role\nin modern literature, where language tran-\nscends simple communication to explore\nprofound existential questions.\n1\nIntroduction\nThis paper explores Samuel Beckett’s play ”Not\nI,” focusing on its unique narrative structure and\nprofound thematic depth.\n”Not I” is character-\nized by its minimalistic approach, where the en-\ntirety of the play revolves around a single charac-\nter, known as ”Mouth,” who delivers a rapid, frag-\nmented monologue that plunges the audience into\nthe depths of existential despair and identity cri-\nsis. Through this study, we aim to analyze the lin-\nguistic intricacies and the existential themes that\ndominate the play, offering insights into Beckett’s\nuse of language as a tool for expressing the human\ncondition.\nOur analysis is particularly interested in the\nplay’s exploration of themes such as isolation,\nidentity, and the struggle for meaning within the\nframework of existential philosophy. The mono-\nlogue’s repetitive and disjointed nature not only\nreflects the protagonist’s fragmented psyche but\nalso highlights Beckett’s stylistic departure from\ntraditional narrative forms, emphasizing a stream-\nof-consciousness technique that challenges the\nboundaries of theatrical presentation.\nThis paper seeks to dissect the layers of com-\nplexity in Beckett’s text, drawing connections be-\ntween the play’s stylistic elements and its broader\nexistential themes. In exploring the use of min-\nimalism in ”Not I” and its ability to evoke pro-\nfound emotional responses, we hope to enhance\nthe understanding of its role within Beckett’s body\nof work and the broader context of modern theatre.\n1.1\nBeckett’s writing style\nSamuel Beckett’s writing style is characterized by\nminimalism and the economical use of language.\nHe employs sparse dialogue and simple vocabu-\nlary, focusing on the essence of human experience.\nRepetition of words, phrases, and scenes is a hall-\nmark of his work, emphasizing the monotony and\ncyclical nature of existence. Beckett explores ex-\nistential themes such as absurdity, isolation, and\ndespair, often using non-linear narratives and long\nintrospective monologues. His settings are mini-\nmalist, with rich symbolism and imagery reflect-\ning the emptiness of the human condition. Beck-\nett’s innovative use of language and structure chal-\nlenges traditional theatrical norms.\n1.2\nNOT I\n”Not\nI”\nby\nSamuel\nBeckett\nis\na\ndramatic\nmonologue characterized by a single character,\n”Mouth,” who delivers a rapid and fragmented\nstream of consciousness. The narrative is chaotic\nand disjointed, reflecting the character’s inner tur-\nmoil and fragmented mental state. Beckett uses\nrepetitive language and simple, stark vocabulary\nto create a rhythmic, almost musical quality. The\nplay explores themes of existential despair, iden-\ntity, isolation, and trauma, with the disembodied\narXiv:2410.09608v1  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2024\nmouth symbolizing the compulsion to speak de-\nspite the futility of communication.\nInfluenced\nby existential philosophy, ”Not I” delves into the\nabsurdity of human existence and the search for\nmeaning in a seemingly meaningless world.\n1.3\nObjectives\nTo elucidate the complex layers of text within\n”Not I”, we conducted three distinct analyses:\n• Word Frequency Analysis We utilized a\nword cloud to visually represent the most fre-\nquently occurring words within the text, pro-\nviding insights into the thematic and narrative\nemphasis of the play\n• Emotional Analysis Employing a BERT-\nbased transformer model for emotion recog-\nnition, we analyzed the emotional undertones\nconveyed through the monologue, charting\nthe prevalence and shifts in emotional inten-\nsity throughout the play.\n• Repetitive Pattern Analysis Through two\nspecific plots, we examined the occurrences\nof repetitive words and the longest repetitive\nmotives, shedding light on the play’s struc-\nture and Beckett’s use of repetition to empha-\nsize the cyclical nature of the protagonist’s\nthoughts.\n2\nBackground\nThe analysis of rhythm and repetition in liter-\nary texts has long been a focus of both theoreti-\ncal and computational research. Early approaches\nto rhythm in literature often centered on rhetor-\nical structures and prosody.\nFor instance, stud-\nies have explored the role of rhythm as a com-\nmunicative device, using linguistic structures such\nas syllabic patterns and punctuation to establish\nrhythmic units within texts [Balint et al., 2016].\nComputational methods have since evolved, au-\ntomating the detection of rhythmic figures, which\nhas proven valuable in analyzing prose across cen-\nturies [Lagutina et al., 2020].\nHowever, these\nmethods, though useful for identifying surface-\nlevel rhythmic patterns, often lack the sophistica-\ntion to handle more complex, non-linear narratives\nlike Samuel Beckett’s Not I. Most rhythm analy-\nsis tools, particularly in earlier studies, have been\ndesigned for languages or texts with predictable\nprosodic patterns, such as French poetry [Boychuk\net al., 2014], leaving a gap in handling experimen-\ntal works that rely on disjointed, rapid speech.\nRepetition is another critical element that\nshapes both form and meaning in literary texts.\n[Tannen, 2007] highlights how repetition in dia-\nlogue establishes coherence and amplifies emo-\ntional tones, a principle particularly relevant to\ndramatic works.\nStudies have classified rep-\netition into various forms—such as positional,\nassociative, and aggregative—focusing on how\nthese forms shape textual structures [Altmann and\nK¨ohler, 2015].\nPositional repetition refers to\nthe recurrence of units in specific locations within\nthe text, such as at the beginning or end of sen-\ntences, which can create patterns of emphasis\nand rhythm. Associative repetition occurs when\nwords or phrases are repeated alongside certain\nother words, suggesting deeper semantic links.\nAggregative repetition involves clusters of re-\npeated units appearing in concentrated sections of\na text, often creating a sense of intensity or fo-\ncus around particular ideas or emotions.\nThese\ndifferent forms of repetition are not only stylistic\nchoices but also serve to reinforce themes and mo-\ntifs within a text. Despite the substantial insights\ngained from these classifications, their application\nto more fragmented and non-linear texts, such as\nBeckett’s Not I, has not been thoroughly explored,\nparticularly in how repetition might reflect a dis-\nordered mental state or fragmented identity.\nCurrent approaches to sentiment and emotion\nanalysis in literary texts have predominantly fo-\ncused on character-to-character interactions in\nworks like Shakespeare’s plays, where sentiment\nanalysis tools are used to track emotional shifts\nthrough dialogue [Nalisnick and Baird, 2013].\nThese methods, however, often assume more sta-\nble narratives, whereas Beckett’s work presents\nemotional fragmentation. Emotion analysis of lit-\nerature has expanded into generating high-quality\nemotion arcs, offering a more dynamic view of\ncharacter emotions [Teodorescu and Mohammad,\n2022], but these approaches have yet to be applied\nto monologues that, like Not I, intentionally dis-\nrupt narrative flow to reflect fractured identity. Our\nresearch addresses this by leveraging today’s deep\nlearning models, which allow for more sophisti-\ncated tracking of emotional shifts in fragmented,\nnon-linear speech patterns, exceeding the capacity\nof earlier lexicon-based tools [Yavuz, 2020].\nAdditionally, discourse analysis tools have tra-\nditionally focused on the logical structure of di-\nalogue and narrative [Crossley et al., 2014], but\nthese have not been extensively adapted to the ex-\ntreme minimalism found in Beckett’s monologue.\nThe absence of clear interlocutors and the focus\non internalized speech require a more advanced\nlevel of analysis. Recent advancements in Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP), such as transformer-\nbased models, allow for a deeper and more nu-\nanced exploration of these texts [Tunstall et al.,\n2022], enabling us to model the rhythmic frag-\nmentation and its psychological impact.\nExisting rhythm detection tools provide valu-\nable insights into metrical structures and patterns,\nyet they remain limited in their application to texts\nthat break conventional rhythmic forms, such as\nBeckett’s use of rapid, disjointed speech. Earlier\nrhythm extraction models rely on pre-defined pat-\nterns and lack the flexibility to adapt to experimen-\ntal literature [Niculescu and Trausan-Matu, 2016].\nWe address this by integrating deep learning mod-\nels that can analyze irregular, non-linear text struc-\ntures, providing a more accurate depiction of the\nchaotic rhythm that defines Not I.\nOur research fills these gaps by applying ad-\nvanced NLP techniques and deep learning mod-\nels to analyze repetition, rhythm, and emotional\nfragmentation in Not I. While earlier studies laid\nthe groundwork for understanding literary rhythm\nand emotion, they have not adequately addressed\nworks that defy conventional narrative structures.\nBy using transformer models and state-of-the-art\nNLP tools, we are able to capture the complex in-\nterplay of rhythm, repetition, and identity in Beck-\nett’s monologue, offering a new framework for\nanalyzing experimental literature that challenges\nboth linguistic and narrative norms.\n3\nMethodology\nTo prepare the text of ”Not I” for analysis, we im-\nplemented a systematic approach to ensure the in-\ntegrity and quality of the data suitable for NLP.\nThis approach involved extracting text, cleaning\nit, segmenting it, and using various NLP tools and\ntechniques to carry out a detailed linguistic and\nemotional analysis. The codes used for this analy-\nsis are all available at the GitHub repository.\n3.1\nText Extraction and Preprocessing\nText Extraction: We employed the Tesseract Op-\ntical Character Recognition (OCR) tool to digitize\nthe printed pages of ”Not I,” converting them into\nmachine-readable text. Cleaning: The digitized\ntexts were meticulously cleaned to remove OCR\nerrors, irrelevant formatting, and non-textual ele-\nments, ensuring the data’s purity for subsequent\nanalysis. Text Segmentation: Recognizing the the-\natrical nature of the text, we segmented the play\ninto 30-word units, each approximating 10 to 15\nseconds of stage time, to analyze linguistic and\nemotional content in manageable, performance-\nrelevant chunks.\n3.2\nLinguistic Analysis\nUsing the spaCy library configured for the English\nlanguage, we conducted a detailed linguistic anal-\nysis, which included:\nWord Frequency and Word Clouds: We identi-\nfied the most common words and visualized them\nusing WordCloud in matplotlib, highlighting key\nthematic elements of the text. Vocabulary Rich-\nness: We computed lexical diversity to assess the\nlinguistic complexity and stylistic variance across\nthe play.\n3.3\nEmotion Detection\nTo capture a nuanced spectrum of emotions, we\nutilized a BERT-based transformer model via\nHugging Face’s pipeline for text classification\n[Hartmann, 2022]. This model provided scores for\nmultiple emotions, enabling us to develop a de-\ntailed emotional profile of each segment.\n3.4\nRepetitive Pattern Analysis\nWe designed a Python script employing regular\nexpressions and array manipulations to locate and\ndocument the positions of frequently occurring\nwords.\nThese positions were then visually rep-\nresented through scatter plots on a Gantt chart,\nenhancing our understanding of word distribution\nand frequency across the text, which aided in iden-\ntifying significant linguistic patterns.\n4\nResults\nThis section presents the analysis of the emotional\nlandscape in Samuel Beckett’s ”Not I” as depicted\nthrough a pie chart of emotion distribution. Figure\n1 illustrates the proportion of each emotion cap-\ntured through the text analysis.\nFigure 1: Pie chart showing the distribution of emotions in ”Not I.”\n4.1\nAnalysis of Emotions\n4.1.1\nSurprise\nThe predominant emotion in ”Not I” is surprise,\nwhich is reflected in several aspects of the text:\n• Linguistic Patterns: The frequent usage of\nthe exclamation ”oh” highlights a continuous\nsense of astonishment.\n• Character\nBehavior:\nThe\ncharacter\n”Mouth” consistently uses interrogatives like\n”when,” ”who,” and ”what,” underscoring\na state of bewilderment due to the lack of\ndefinitive answers.\n• Punctuation: The absence of periods and the\nreliance on exclamation and question marks\namplify the theme of surprise, with the text\nconcluding with a dash (”-”), reinforcing the\nunresolved, astonished tone.\n4.1.2\nSadness\nSadness emerges as the second most prevalent\nemotion, supporting Beckett’s exploration of de-\nspair:\n• Contextual Expectation: Beckett’s works\nare known for their bleak outlook, making the\npervasive sadness in ”Not I” a direct reflec-\ntion of his narrative style.\n• Character Expression: The fragmented and\ndisjointed speech of ”Mouth” conveys deep\nloss and hopelessness, mirroring the underly-\ning sadness of the narrative.\n4.1.3\nNeutrality\nNeutrality is identified as the third significant emo-\ntional tone, intriguing given the play’s minimalist\napproach:\n• Language Use: The rapid succession of sim-\nple, emotionally neutral words contributes to\na dense, minimally expressive linguistic tex-\nture.\n• Narrative Style: The disorganized delivery\nby ”Mouth” suggests a struggle with dis-\njointed memories, lending a neutral tone to\nthe narrative.\n• Character’s Condition:\nThe portrayal of\n”Mouth” as a character grappling with\nAlzheimer’s disease, attempting to piece to-\ngether fragmented memories, reflects the\nsimplicity and neutrality of the language,\ndominated by the necessity to speak.\n4.1.4\nOther Emotions\nOther emotions present in the text exhibit a bal-\nanced distribution, consistent with the content of\nthe play and contributing less critically to the over-\nall emotional analysis compared to surprise, sad-\nness, and neutrality.\n4.2\nQuantitative Textual Analysis\nIn this section, we delve into the quantitative as-\npects of word usage in Samuel Beckett’s ”Not I,”\nfocusing on the most frequently occurring words\nas illustrated in Figure 2 and detailed in Table 1.\nWord\nFrequency\nTime\n17\nBuzzing\n15\nLong\n14\nWhat?\n13\nLike\n13\nOh\n10\nSudden\n10\nTable 1: Table of the top 7 most frequently oc-\ncurring words in ”Not I,” excluding common stop-\nwords.\n4.2.1\nLinguistic Significance of\nHigh-Frequency Words\nThe analysis of high-frequency words provides in-\nsights into the thematic concerns and the narrative\nstyle employed by Beckett. The terms identified\noffer a window into the emotional and psycholog-\nical state of the protagonist, ”Mouth.”\nThe frequent repetition of specific words\nis instrumental in underscoring the protagonist\n”Mouth’s” psychological and emotional turmoil.\nEach key term contributes distinctively to the nar-\nrative’s depth:\n• ”Time” Everything in this play is about time.\nSpecifically, it is about the passage of time,\nthe deterioration of the mind due to the pas-\nsage of time (aging), the erratic back and\nforth in time, the disjointed journey through\ntime, the discovery of time, and ultimately\nthe loss of time.\n• ”Buzzing” This repetition underscores the\nincessant nature of the sounds within the pro-\ntagonist’s skull, representing a relentless tor-\nment. When ”Mouth” utters this word, it sig-\nnifies moments where she momentarily takes\ncontrol of the voice, screaming to identify the\nexact nature of these sounds. The ”buzzing”\nsymbolizes the overwhelming flood of frag-\nmented and unclear memories that plague her\nmind.\n• ”Long” Despite everything being conveyed\nquickly in the text, the events are spaced far\napart in the core of the story. the character\nstands at a great spatial and temporal distance\nfrom her memories at this moment and tries\nto search through these distances rapidly.\n• ”Imagine” The frequently repeated word\n”imagine” is used by ”Mouth” to command\nand urge the brain to imagine and recall\nagain. It is as if ”Mouth”, after saying and\nhearing a series of memories, suddenly real-\nizes what was heard and wants to imagine it\nall over again.\n• ”Sudden” underlines the abrupt and often\nshocking re-emergence of repressed memo-\nries or thoughts.\n• Terms\nrelated\nto\nbodily\nparts\nsuch\nas\n”Brain”, ”Mouth”, and ”Hand” emphasize\nthe physicality of the protagonist’s existential\nand corporeal experience.\nThrough the meticulous repetition of these\nwords, Beckett not only crafts a rhythmic and\ncompelling narrative but also constructs a vivid\nportrayal of the protagonist’s fragmented psyche.\nThe methodological approach combining compu-\ntational linguistics and traditional literary analy-\nsis enhances our understanding of the play’s deep-\nseated themes of memory, identity, and existential\nangst.\nFigure 2: Word cloud depicting the predominant words in ”Not I.”\n4.3\nRepetitive Lexical Patterns\nThis study utilizes a Gantt chart with a scatter plot,\nas shown in Figure 3, to illustrate the distribu-\ntion and clustering of word occurrences in Samuel\nBeckett’s ”Not I.” The analysis highlights the im-\nplicit structuring of the text, which mirrors the tra-\nditional three-act format through its lexical repeti-\ntions.\n4.3.1\nImplicit Structuring Through Lexical\nClustering\nThe text’s division into three major clusters sug-\ngests an underlying three-act structure that Beck-\nett does not explicitly denote. Each cluster cor-\nresponds to a distinct narrative phase within the\nplay:\n• Cluster One: Encompassing the initial seg-\nments of the text, this cluster includes fre-\nquent repetitions of ”buzzing,” ”time,” and\n”long,” which introduce the central themes\nand set the emotional tone.\n• Cluster Two: Situated in the middle seg-\nments, this cluster features ”mouth,” ”sud-\nden,” and ”imagine,” indicating a progression\nin the narrative and the protagonist’s deepen-\ning engagement with her memories.\n• Cluster Three:\nFound in the concluding\nsegments, this includes repetitions of ”oh,”\n”what,” and ”far,” reflecting the culmination\nof the narrative and the protagonist’s unre-\nsolved queries.\n4.3.2\nLinguistic and Narrative Insights\nThe analysis of these clusters reveals not only the\nplay’s unique narrative structure but also Beckett’s\nstrategic use of language to deepen the narrative’s\ncomplexity:\n• Rhythmic and Musical Language:\nThe\nrepetitive nature of the selected words across\nclusters introduces a rhythmic, almost musi-\ncal quality to the monologue, aiding in the\nportrayal of the protagonist’s fluctuating psy-\nchological states.\n• Cognitive and Emotional Mapping: The\nwords within each cluster help map the cog-\nnitive and emotional journey of the character,\n”Mouth,” illustrating her struggle with frag-\nmented memories and existential questions.\n4.4\nLongest Repetitive Subsequences (Motifs)\nThis section discusses the analysis of the longest\nrepetitive subsequences, or motifs, within the text\nof Samuel Beckett’s Not I. The motifs are crucial\nin understanding the rhythmic and structural com-\nposition of the text.\nFigure 4 shows a chart displaying the longest\nrepetitive subsequences, with the first three words\nFigure 3: Gantt chart with scatter plot of word occurrences in ”Not I,” illustrating the clustering of lexical\nrepetitions.\nFigure 4: Chart depicting the longest repetitive subsequences in Not I.\nand the last two words of each repeated segment\nhighlighted. Examples of such motifs include:\n• “brought up as...god first”\n• “new every morning...it up”\n• “before its time...practically speechless”\n• “few steps then...drifting around”\nThese motifs recur at various points throughout\nthe text, illustrating the structural repetition em-\nployed by Beckett.\n4.4.1\nSignificance of Motifs\nThe motifs provide evidence that Beckett’s text\nemploys paragraph-length structures in a rhythmic\nmanner, akin to a musical composition. The entire\ntext can be likened to a recursive pattern, where\nlanguage is used to create a complex and layered\nauditory experience.\n4.4.2\nMusical Structure in Text\n• Rhythmic Repetition:\nThe repetition of\nlarger motifs creates a rhythmic flow within\nthe narrative, mirroring the repetitive nature\nof individual words.\n• Recursive Patterns:\nThe text’s linguistic\nstructure exhibits recursive patterns that en-\nhance its musicality, reflecting the complex-\nity and depth of the narrative.\n• Musical Analog: This structural approach\nparallels the use of canons in music, where\na melody is repeated and imitated at different\nintervals.\nThrough the meticulous repetition of these mo-\ntifs, Beckett not only crafts a rhythmic and com-\npelling narrative but also constructs a vivid por-\ntrayal of the protagonist’s fragmented psyche. The\ntext’s recursive structure and its similarity to mu-\nsical canons highlight the deliberate use of repeti-\ntion to deepen the audience’s engagement with the\nplay’s themes and emotional landscape.\n5\nConclusion\nThis study has systematically dissected Samuel\nBeckett’s ”Not I” through advanced natural lan-\nguage processing techniques, revealing the pro-\nfound complexity and structured repetition that\nunderscore the play’s essence. Our analyses have\ndemonstrated that Beckett employs a meticulously\nrecursive linguistic framework that mirrors the\npsychological fragmentation of the protagonist.\nThe integration of word frequency analysis illu-\nminated the thematic focus on time, memory, and\nexistential turmoil, while emotional analysis un-\nderscored the predominant feelings of surprise and\nsadness, reflecting the play’s intense emotional\nlandscape. Finally, the examination of repetitive\nmotifs highlighted Beckett’s use of language as a\nmusical and fractal element, reinforcing the play’s\nrhythmic and recursive narrative structure. Col-\nlectively, these findings not only deepen our un-\nderstanding of Beckett’s stylistic modulations but\nalso underscore his unique contribution to mod-\nern literature, where language transcends simple\ncommunication to evoke profound existential re-\nflections.\nReferences\nGabriel Altmann and Reinhard K¨ohler.\nForms\nand degrees of repetition in texts: detection and\nanalysis, volume 68.
