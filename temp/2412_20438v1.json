INTRODUCTION \nThe financial sector is an important and a driving force \nof the worldwide economic development and it is having a \nrapid development due to the use of the latest intelligent \ntechnologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP). \nThe period of 2018-2023 covered in this research paper \nimplies an important one, where NLPs have seen an \nexponential growth with the Large Language Models \n(LLMs) projects like ChatGPTs, Gemini, Bard and Bing \nexploration and models deeper specifications.  \nFor the scope of this research paper, we refer to the Finance \nfield as the Financial System (FS) as it encompasses \nvarious components such as; public finance, international \nfinance, corporate finance, derivatives, risk management, \nportfolio theory, asset pricing (AP), and financial \neconomics [1].  \nA detailed view of the search methods and machine \nlearning tools in language processing, including classifiers \nand sequence models, techniques like decision trees (DT), \nsupport vector machines (SVM), and cross-validation is \nessential for evaluating NLP systems [2]. We will give \nexamples of the use of NLP techniques in the next sections \nin this research, enhancing their understanding by \ndelivering the research questions as following:  \nQ1: What are the NLP models and techniques used for \nanalyzing FS components in the time span of 2018-2023? \nQ2: What are the challenges and limitations in the \napplications of NLP to the FS regarding text-mining \napplications on the engineering perspective of data \nprocessing? \n \n2. THE APPLICATIONS OF NLP MODELS AND \nTECHNIQUES IN FINANCIAL SYSTEM \nGoing deeper into example cases, we discover an \nongoing trend that is growing fast. To analyze the subject-\nmatter we go through a time span of 2018-2023. \n \n2.1. Materials and Methods  \nThe path used to answer to Q1 is built on the \nmethodology of filtering in the Google Scholar search \nengine.  There are included citations and patents with the \nquery as follows: (NLP OR “Natural Language \nProcessing”) AND “*FS element mentioned in chapter \n1”AND text mining AND forecasting AND prediction \nAND models. To give answer to our research questions we \nexplored around 250 scientific materials, from which 35 of \nthem books and the rest papers and articles. After selecting \nthe scientific materials filtered, we reached to a total of \naround one hundred and nine (109) papers, articles, books \nand similar. For the scope of this research paper, we \nclassified and analyzed around sixty (60) study materials. \n \nInternational Journal on “Technical and Physical Problems of Engineering” (IJTPE), Iss. 61, Vol. 16, No. 4, Dec. 2024 \n2 \n2.2. Results \nFigure 1 shows that the focus of most studies relies on \nAP, (especially on stock prediction), while having the \ncorporate finances as the second most studied component \nof FS. \n \n \nFigure 1. Histogram of scientific materials extracted and classified \naccording to Financial System Components for the years 2018-2023 \n \nFrom the actual database of scientific materials, we \nalso noticed that most of NLP models were a combination \nof probabilistic and vector-based ones. Whereas, regarding \nthe classification on NLP techniques evidenced, we can \nrefer to Figure 2. As we can see, the information \nclassification techniques and the combination of the all \nthree ones, has most of the works used during the time span \nstudy. \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Histogram of scientific materials extracted and classified \naccording to information processing NLP techniques, years 2018-2023, \n \nWe noticed a growing number of articles which \ncombined both probabilistic with VSM, and also combined \ntext-data with numerical ones. A systematic and critical \nreview of deep learning in financial economics is provided \nby using hybrid variants of methods [3]. The work [4] \nforecasted economic trends using sentiment analysis, \nAutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (ARX) and Lasso \non data from articles from six newspapers showing varying \nlevels of accuracy. The Numeric Hierarchical Transformer \nModel (NumHTML) for financial forecasting using \nearning conference calls data was introduced in the year of \n2022 [5]. As these studies remain near the financial \neconomics area, they also might have infusions of other \ntopics, showing at least, a low interest on the matter.  \nA textual analysis of China's financial markets is \nconducted with sentiment analysis [6]. The work of [30] \nused \ntransformers \nfor \nsentiment \nanalysis \non \nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) news. \nDatasets on the international finance FS component are of \nvarious data sources, as they help to create an international \npoint of view on the topic. \nAs for the portfolio theory application of NLPs, we can \nelaborate works that underpin the interconnection of the \nfields of FS and NLP. An important work [7] applies \nfinancial Bidirectional Encoder Representations from \nTransformers (FinBERT), Monte Carlo, and Black and \nLitterman model for portfolio optimization on Milano \nFinanza data. Whereas, [28] investigated the importance of \nfinancial sentiment in portfolio management using RF, \nMulti-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and LSTM on data from \nQuandl and StockFluence APIs. Here we have to mention \neven the use of datasets from other sectors for training \nmodels, which can be sub-optimal, highlighting the need \nfor more sector-specific annotated datasets [8,9,10]. The \ndiverse number of techniques used, show of a versatile \nsub-field, where data and information are not absent, but \nneeds more attention in the future, for taking proper \nfinancial decisions and predictions to the investors. \nThe public finance component is elaborated in some \nworks below though, there is a need to be further \ninvestigated. Work of [11] applied machine learning to \nbudget speech statements. The article of [12] examined tax \ncompliance \nbehavior \nusing \nBidirectional \nEncoder \nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) on survey \nresponses. A bank financial risk prediction model is \ndeveloped using big data from commercial banks, \nemploying Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection \nOperator (Lasso) and SVM [29]. The SVM techniques [13] \nand hybrid deep learning models [14] show their global use \nin different fields, we can mention the healthcare one. \nWhereas the finance field is evolving, the need for \nintelligent methods is rising, as it is a crucial point when \ntaking financial decisions, and is applied thoroughly in \nevery other component presented above. \nThrough our work we saw that the stock predictions \nremain the most studied topic, in the AP component of the \nFS, and that the AP component of the FS is the most \nstudied topic compared to other components. There might \nbe different reasons, but what we can deduce is that there \nare more open databases that allow the latter topic to be \nstudied and also, it is a very fast needed information. An \ninvestor has to have an accurate and timely information on \nstocks or in AP, in order to take proper decision. There is \nevidenced a variety of datasets utilized, including financial \nnews databases. stock returns data, corporate financial \nreports (e.g., 10-K filings), and social media data (e.g., \nStockTwits, Weibo).  \nThe most used common specific techniques, as \npresented in Figure 3. include BERT types, Long Short-\nTerm Memory (LSTM) and Logistic Regression (LR), \nwhereas Lasso, Bag of Words (Bow), NEUS, K-Nearest \nNeighbors (KNN), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Deep \nLearning (DL), Generalized Autoregressive Conditional \nHeteroskedasticity \n(GARCH) \nand \nAutoregressive \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nNo.of NLP scientific materials\nInformation\nRetreaval\nInformation\nClassification\nInformation\nExtraction\nCombination\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nNo.of scientific materials according to information proccessing NLP\ntechniques\nInternational Journal on “Technical and Physical Problems of Engineering” (IJTPE), Iss. 61, Vol. 16, No. 4, Dec. 2024 \n3 \nIntegrated Moving Average (ARIMA) are to be \nmentioned.

DISCUSSION \nThis research highlighted several limitations on the text \nengineering perspective in the application of NLP to FSs \nin order to answer to Q2. It leverages the past works’ [15] \nlimitations and challenges (restriction to confidential data, \nabsence of well-defined financial lexicon lists, lack of \ndynamic texts analysis models, need of club inter-domain \nresults, highly un-structured and redundant data, sarcasm \nand vernacular language) are not fully appointed yet. Let \nus point out the evolution of the challenges from the time \nof the study’s [15] analysis to the end of the year 2023. A \nsignificant issue is the data shift between training corpora \nand real estate headlines, leading to poor performance in \nevent extraction [16]. Traditional models like the Fama-\nFrench 5-factor model (FF5) face overfitting problems, \nhighlighting superiority of newer models like Generalized \nNews-based Sentiment Analysis (GNUS) [17].   \nWhereas even the latter like deep learning models \nencounter \nchallenges \nwith \nNon-Independent \nand \nIdentically Distributed (non-IID) samples, time-varying \ndistributions, and low signal-to-noise ratios, complicating \nstock return predictions such as in [18]. Refs. [17, 18] \nindicate a partially addressed issue of Gupta, et al. [15] \nchallenges to the lack of dynamic text analysis models. \nThere is a limited interpretability of advanced models like \nBERT and Word2Vec that restricts their application, \nparticularly when not trained on domain-specific texts [19, \n20]. The sentiment analysis models often fail to capture \nfinancial context adequately due to reliance on general \nlexicons [21], a challenge not yet solved since the research \npaper [15] reference on absence of well-defined financial \nlexicon lists.  \nFurther, data quality and causality issues persist, \nmaking it difficult to establish reliable links between \nsentiment indicators and outcomes [22]. The overreliance \non numerical data in models overlooks qualitative factors \nlike managerial experience, which could enhance \npredictions [23]. The matter of scalability and adaptability \nof models to real-time data remain challenging, \nparticularly in evolving financial markets [24]. Even the \nexpert annotations based on prior beliefs can be incorrect, \nemphasizing need for context-based annotations [25]. The \ninfancy of text analysis in finance requires comprehensive \nresearch to fully understand its potential [4].  \nAdditionally, the use of datasets from other sectors for \ntraining models can be sub-optimal, highlighting the need \nfor more sector-specific annotated datasets [10]. Future \nresearch should take into consideration market frictions \nand transaction costs in trading strategies [26]. While some \n[15] challenges are mentioned above, the other ones such \nrestriction to confidential data, need of club inter-domain \nresults, highly un-structured and redundant data, sarcasm \nand vernacular language and the new ones we presented \nabove resonate a need to address them as quickly as \npossible. Lastly, we can state that advanced NLP models \nshow promise but require further investigation to address \ntheir current limitations and optimize their use in financial \npredictions [27].  \n \nTable 1.

Figures 4 and 5 explain visually the steps as per \nfollows. \nAfter determining the where we will delve in while \nfollowing the Figure 4, we follow the text analyzing steps \nmentioned in Jurafsky and Martin 2020 [2]. Figure 5 \nexplains in detail the broader panorama of analyzing \nfinancial text in the language context and the specific \nlimitations encountered from our work in the research \npapers analyzed. In the right side of each step, there are \nmentioned the most encountered limitations. These \nlimitations should be taken into account when dealing with \nproblems of the same field as this research paper handles. \n2%\n10%\n3%\n2%\n2%\n2%\n2%\n5%\n2%\n10%\n12%\n3%\n47%\nInternational Journal on “Technical and Physical Problems of Engineering” (IJTPE), Iss. 61, Vol. 16, No. 4, Dec. 2024 \n4 \nFinancial texts remain difficult to understand as they \nhave a specific domain language. The models and \nlimitations discussed in this research paper tend to make \neasier the first stage of a research, the state of the art. After \nchoosing the FS component field, NLP model and \ntechniques, the language analysis and having into account \nthe proper limitations as expressed in Figure 5, the data \npreparation should begin.  \n \n \nFigure 4. The first step is to determine the FS component to work on \nwith and the NLP technique regarding information processing and \nmodel algorithms. In the left side FS components, in the right side the \nmost used NLP techniques for each component. In the bottom the most \nprobable data source. “Other” and “Combination” have the same \nmeaning as mentioned in Figures 1 and 2. In this Figure there are \nmentioned the most used NLP techniques and models \n \n4. CONCLUSIONS \nDespite the limitations, NLP holds substantial promise for \nenhancing the FS. Their mixed applications can \nsignificantly improve the accuracy of predictions, such as \nstock prices and asset returns, by taking large amounts of \ntextual data from news articles, social media, and financial \nreports. Advanced models like BERT and LSTM, and their \nmodified \nmodels, \nhave \ndemonstrated \nsuperior \nperformance in capturing the nuances of financial \nlanguage and predicting market movements. Integrating \ndeep learning techniques into financial models not only \nenhances prediction accuracy but also helps uncover \nunderlying economic mechanisms, offering deeper \nempirical insights into AP. Furthermore, NLP can \nfacilitate better sentiment analysis, crucial for gauging \nmarket sentiment and making informed investment \ndecisions. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5. Second step is to determine the problem on language terms \nand in which phase of language analysis it will go on to.
