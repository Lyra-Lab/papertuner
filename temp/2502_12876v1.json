INTRODUCTION\nThe ﬁeld of conversational AI has experienced rapid\nprogress, with models like GPT-4o and Gemini exhibiting so-\nphisticated language understanding and generation [4]. While\nproﬁcient in general dialogue, these models often lack the\nability to deliver truly tailored experiences that adapt to in-\ndividual users over time. Continuous Learning Conversational\nAI (CLCA) aims to address this limitation by developing\nAI companions that learn and personalize through ongoing\nengagement. This paper explores a speciﬁc CLCA implemen-\ntation, utilizing Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to construct personalized sales agents.\nInspired by RL’s success in complex domains, such as\ngame playing [2], [6], our CLCA method employs simulated\nconversations to train an A2C agent. Unlike pre-trained, static\nLLMs, our system acquires knowledge through interaction\nwithin a simulated environment. This environment is built\nupon synthetic sales dialogues, generated using LLMs to\nmimic realistic agent-customer interactions. The A2C agent is\ntrained to perform actions that optimize key dialogue metrics,\npersonalizing sales interactions for improved effectiveness and\nuser focus.\nThis paper details the technical framework of our A2C-\npowered CLCA system. We describe synthetic data creation,\nRL environment design, reward function formulation to guide\nlearning, and the role of LLMs in both response generation and\nevaluation. We argue that this RL-driven approach provides a\npractical method for creating genuinely personalized dialogue\nagents, overcoming limitations inherent in generalized LLMs.\nOur goal is to clearly articulate the technical foundations\nof CLCA, showcasing its potential and encouraging further\nresearch in this critical area of AI development.\nII. SIMULATING PERSONALIZED DIALOGUES FOR\nREINFORCEMENT LEARNING\nSynthetic sales dialogues are a fundamental element of our\nCLCA implementation. This simulation serves a dual purpose:\ngenerating a comprehensive dataset for initial training and\nproviding an interactive environment for RL agent learning.\nWe use LLMs to generate these dialogues, ensuring realism\nand tailoring them to speciﬁc business proﬁles.\nA. LLM-Driven Synthetic Data Generation\nThe data generation process begins by deﬁning a ‘Compa-\nnyProﬁle‘, which includes core attributes such as company ID,\nname, sales goals, product category, and intended audience.\nThese proﬁles, derived from document uploads or manual\ninput, establish the context for dialogue generation. We utilize\nLLMs to create diverse sales scenarios, each represented as\na JSON object detailing customer characteristics, concerns,\ntechnical understanding, and motivations. Algorithm 1 outlines\nthe scenario creation process.\nFollowing scenario creation, LLMs are again used to\ngenerate complete dialogues between a sales representative\nand a customer, based on the scenario. These dialogues are\nstructured as turns, each specifying the speaker (customer or\nrepresentative) and message content. Importantly, each dia-\nlogue includes metadata such as the outcome (sale success or\nfailure), key discussion points, value propositions, and handled\nobjections. This detailed annotation enriches the dataset and\nAlgorithm 1 LLM-Based Scenario Generation\n1: Input: Company Proﬁle P\n2: Output: Dialogue Scenario S (JSON object)\n3: Deﬁne a prompt for scenario generation, incorporating P’s\nattributes.\n4: Query an LLM with the deﬁned prompt.\n5: Parse the LLM response to extract a JSON object S =\n{persona, primary concern, ...}.\n6: return S\nprovides valuable learning signals for the RL agent. Algorithm\n2 details the dialogue creation process.\nAlgorithm 2 LLM-Based Dialogue Generation\n1: Input: Company Proﬁle P, Scenario S\n2: Output: Dialogue Data C (JSON object)\n3: Deﬁne a prompt for dialogue generation, incorporating P\nand S.\n4: Query an LLM with the prompt.\n5: Parse the LLM response to extract a JSON object C =\n{conversation, outcome, key points discussed, ...}.\n6: return C\nTo represent these dialogues in a feature space suitable for\nRL, we extract semantic embeddings from the full dialogue\ntext using Azure OpenAI’s models. These embeddings capture\nthe semantic essence of each exchange, serving as the primary\ninput features for our RL agent and enabling learning from\nnuanced aspects of simulated dialogues.\nB. Reinforcement Learning Environment Design\nThe synthetic dialogues form the basis of our ‘SalesEnv‘, a\nGymnasium environment speciﬁcally designed for A2C agent\ntraining. This environment simulates sales interactions, allow-\ning the agent to learn effective dialogue strategies through trial\nand error.\n1) State Space: The state space in our environment is struc-\ntured to provide the agent with relevant context. It includes two\nkey components:\n• Dialogue Embeddings: Pre-calculated embeddings of\nsynthetic dialogues, capturing their semantic essence.\nThese are the core features, representing the context of\nthe sales interaction.\n• Historical Statistics: A 4-dimensional vector represent-\ning statistics of the agent’s past actions, updated at each\nstep. This provides a short-term memory for adaptive\nbehavior.\nMathematically, the state st at time t is deﬁned as:\nst = [edialogue, ht]\n(1)\nwhere edialogue is the dialogue embedding vector, and ht is\nthe 4-dimensional history statistics vector.\n2) Action Space: The action space directly inﬂuences key\naspects of the dialogue. We deﬁne a 4-dimensional continuous\nspace, with each dimension representing a dialogue metric:\n• Engagement (aengagement): The agent’s effort to main-\ntain customer interest.\n• Value Proposition (avalue proposition): The degree of\nemphasis on the product/service’s value.\n• Technical Detail (atechnical detail): The level of techni-\ncal information provided.\n• Closing (aclosing): The agent’s assertiveness in guiding\nthe conversation towards a sale.\nEach action at:\nat =\n\n\naengagement\navalue proposition\natechnical detail\naclosing\n\n\n(2)\nis a vector with values in the range [0, 1], representing the\ndesired level for each metric. These actions, while abstract\nwithin the RL setting, conceptually inﬂuence LLM response\ngeneration in real-world applications, although not explicitly\nin this simulation.\n3) Reward Function: The reward function guides the A2C\nagent to adopt desirable dialogue behaviors, incentivizing\nsuccessful sales outcomes and effective strategies. It consists\nof three components:\n• Outcome Reward (routcome): A positive reward for\nsuccessful sales, and a negative reward for failures, en-\ncouraging sales-oriented strategies.\n• Action Variety Reward (raction variety): Rewards di-\nverse actions (higher standard deviation) to promote\nexploration and prevent overly simplistic strategies.\n• Extremity Penalty (rextremity penalty): Penalizes ac-\ntions that are far from neutral (0.5), promoting balanced\nand nuanced behavior.\nThe total reward rt at step t is calculated as:\nrt = routcome + raction variety + rextremity penalty\n(3)\nThis reward function balances the achievement of sales with\nthe development of robust and adaptable dialogue strategies.\nIII. A2C AGENT TRAINING AND DIALOGUE RESPONSE\nWith the RL environment deﬁned, we train an A2C agent\nusing Stable Baselines3 to learn optimal dialogue policies.\nA. A2C Model Training\nWe instantiate an A2C model with a multi-layer perceptron\n(MLP) policy network. The architecture includes two hidden\nlayers for both the policy and value functions, using ReLU ac-\ntivations. Optimization is performed using Adam with speciﬁc\nhyperparameters, including learning rate, gamma, and GAE\nlambda, as detailed in the accompanying code. Training in-\nvolves interaction with the ‘SalesEnv‘, gathering experiences,\nand updating the policy and value networks through the A2C\nalgorithm. Algorithm 3 outlines the training process.\nAlgorithm 3 A2C Agent Training\n1: Input: Sales Environment Env, Dialogue Dataset D\n2: Output: Trained A2C Model MA2C\n3: Initialize A2C model MA2C with MLP policy and hyper-\nparameters.\n4: For each training episode:\n5: Reset environment: s0 ←Env.reset()\n6: For each step t in episode:\n7: Agent selects action at ∼MA2C(st).\n8: Environment\ntransitions:\n(st+1, rt, done)\n←\nEnv.step(at).\n9: Store experience (st, at, rt, st+1).\n10: Update A2C model MA2C using experiences.\n11: Return Trained Model MA2C\nThe trained A2C model learns a policy that maps states\n(dialogue embeddings, history statistics) to actions (desired\ndialogue metric vectors). This policy represents the agent’s\nlearned strategy for effective dialogue.\nB. Inference and Response Selection\nAfter training, the A2C model guides response selection in\nlive chat scenarios. When a user provides input, the system\nconstructs the current dialogue state, incorporating dialogue\nhistory and potentially user proﬁles. The A2C agent then\npredicts an action (a vector of desired metrics) based on this\nstate. In this framework, the action scores and selects from a\nset of LLM-generated responses. This is referred to as A2C-\nGuided Response Selection.\nTo generate response options, we sample an LLM using var-\nied temperature settings to encourage diversity. Each generated\noption is evaluated against the A2C agent’s predicted action.\nFeatures relevant to the action metrics are extracted from each\nresponse option. A scoring function, implicitly learned by the\nA2C agent or explicitly designed, assesses each option based\non its alignment with the desired action and extracted features.\nThe response option with the highest score, indicating the best\nalignment with the learned strategy, is selected as the agent’s\nresponse. Algorithm 4 outlines this response selection process.\nAlgorithm 4 A2C-Guided Response Selection\n1: Input: User Message U, Dialogue History H, Trained\nA2C Model MA2C, LLM MLLM\n2: Output: Agent Response A\n3: Construct dialogue state s from H and U.\n4: Predict action a = MA2C(s).\n5: Generate candidate responses {R1, R2, ..., Rk} using\nMLLM at varying temperatures.\n6: For each response Ri:\n7: Extract action metric-relevant features fi.\n8: Calculate score scorei = ScoreFunction(Ri, a, fi).\n9: Select response A = Rj with highest score scorej =\nargmaxiscorei.\n10: Return Agent Response A\nThis approach effectively combines the strengths of RL and\nLLMs. The RL agent provides a high-level strategy, guiding\nthe interaction, while the LLM ensures ﬂuent and contextually\nrelevant natural language responses.\nIV. RELATED WORK AND PERSPECTIVE\nOur work builds upon the growing body of research inte-\ngrating reinforcement learning with conversational AI. Pre-\nvious studies have explored RL for task-oriented dialogue\nsystems [7] and open-domain chatbots [5]. However, many\nRL-based systems have focused on discrete dialogue acts or\npolicies within predeﬁned state spaces. In contrast, our CLCA\napproach emphasizes continuous learning and personalization,\nutilizing synthetic data and continuous action spaces to enable\nmore nuanced and adaptive dialogues.\nCompared to standalone LLMs, which are inherently static,\nor even reasoning-enhanced models [1], [3] that still operate\nwithin a static paradigm, A2C-driven CLCA offers a pathway\nto truly evolving agents. Through continuous learning and RL-\nguided personalization, it can adapt to individual interactions,\npromising enhanced user engagement and effectiveness.\nV. POTENTIAL AND FUTURE TRAJECTORIES\nThe CLCA methodology, particularly with the integration of\nA2C and synthetic data, holds signiﬁcant promise for creating\npersonalized and evolving AI companions. Continuous learn-\ning from both simulated and real-world interactions allows\nfor the dynamic adaptation of dialogue strategies to individual\nusers, potentially leading to more effective and satisfying\nconversations.\nFuture research directions include:\n• Enhanced Reward Design: Developing more sophisti-\ncated and user-centric reward functions to better capture\nthe nuances of dialogue quality and user satisfaction.\n• User Proﬁle Integration: Incorporating detailed user\nproﬁles into the state space to enable ﬁner-grained per-\nsonalization based on individual preferences and interac-\ntion history.\n• Online Reinforcement Learning Transition: Moving\ntowards online RL methods to facilitate continuous, real-\ntime adaptation based on live user interactions.\n• Scalable Personalization Methods: Developing efﬁcient\nand scalable approaches for managing and deploying\npersonalized models across a large number of users.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThis paper has presented a technical description of Con-\ntinuous Learning Conversational AI (CLCA), with a focus\non using A2C reinforcement learning to develop personalized\nsales agents. We have detailed the process of synthetic data\ncreation using LLMs, the design of the RL environment,\nA2C agent training, and the method for A2C-guided response\nselection. Our work demonstrates a practical approach to cre-\nating dynamically evolving and personalized dialogue agents,\nmoving beyond the inherent limitations of static LLMs. While\nchallenges remain, CLCA, with reinforcement learning at its\ncore, offers a compelling direction for the future development\nof personalized AI companions.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe extend our gratitude to the open-source community for\nproviding valuable tools, particularly Stable Baselines3 and\nGymnasium, which were crucial for the implementation of\nCLCA.
